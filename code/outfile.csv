2017-08-21,BMY,https://www.mesotheliomahelp.org/2017/08/results-opdivo-trial-may-help-mesothelioma-oncologists-identify-patients-will-benefit-drug/,,"In April, MesotheliomaHelp reported on the findings of a phase I clinical trial showing that the five-year survival rate for some lung cancer patients treated with Opdivo (nivolumab), an immunotherapy treatment, was “much higher” than historical data. Now, researchers report that results from a phase III clinical trial may help oncologists determine those lung cancer patients, and possibly, mesothelioma patients, who will benefit from the immuno-oncology drug.

Opdivo, developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, works by blocking the PD-L1 protein and activating the immune system, leading it to attack and kill cancer cells. According to a June 21 press release from The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, a team of researchers led by David Carbone, MD, PhD, of The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer – Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute, found that although the trial did not improve progression-free survival when compared with chemotherapy in the overall population, those patients with a high expression of PD-L1 did benefit.

“The good news is that we discovered that a subset of patients who had both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status did experience a significant benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

Specifically, the researchers report that patients who had “both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status” realized a 75 percent response rate compared to just 16 percent response rate with low mutation burden and low PDL-1. However, the response rates for chemotherapy treatment in these same subsets were nearly the same leading the researchers to conclude that the PDL-1 markers “were selective for immunotherapy.”

Mesothelioma, a rare, asbestos-related cancer of the lining of the lungs, abdomen or heart, is highly aggressive and is resistant to many cancer treatments. The prognosis for mesothelioma patients is usually grim: the average survival time varies from 4 – 18 months after diagnosis. For the close to 3,000 Americans diagnosed with the disease each year, personalized care may bring a breakthrough treatment not previously considered by their physician.

The benefits of personalized care for mesothelioma patients have been proven where researchers have identified genetic biomarkers that reflect the aggressiveness of mesothelioma as well as markers that can assess the effectiveness of a particular treatment.

Opdivo is currently in a phase III clinical trial in the UK for mesothelioma patients. Known as The CheckpOiNt Blockade For Inhibition of Relapsed Mesothelioma, or CONIFRM, the trial has a goal of ‘exploiting the potential of immunotherapy.’

Keytruda, which gained popularity after saving former President Jimmy Carter’s life after sending his melanoma into remission, is also a PD-L1 inhibitor. Both immunotherapy drugs have shown in studies to be effective in fighting pleural mesothelioma. Keytruda is, perhaps, more well known due to eight-year mesothelioma survivor Mavis Nye of England, who went into remission after a two-year clinical trial of the drug.

“This study is an important step toward understanding the impact of tumor mutation burden and PDL-1 in immunotherapy response. This data shows we should evaluate these two factors independently to most accurately define who will benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

About Recro Pharma, Inc.

Recro is a specialty pharmaceutical company that operates through two business divisions, an Acute Care, hospital product division and a revenue-generating contract development and manufacturing, or CDMO division, located at the Company's Gainesville facility. The Acute Care division is primarily focused on developing innovative products for hospital and other acute care settings. The Company's lead product candidate is a proprietary injectable form of meloxicam, a long-acting preferential COX-2 inhibitor. IV meloxicam 30mg has successfully completed two pivotal Phase III clinical efficacy trials in patients following bunionectomy and abdominoplasty surgeries, a large double blind Phase III safety trial, four Phase II clinical trials for the management of moderate to severe post-operative pain, as well as other safety studies. As injectable meloxicam is in the non-opioid class of drugs, the Company believes it will overcome many of the issues associated with commonly prescribed opioid therapeutics, including respiratory depression, constipation, excessive nausea and vomiting, as well as having no addictive potential while maintaining meaningful analgesic effects for relief of pain. The Company's CDMO division leverages its formulation expertise to develop and manufacture pharmaceutical products using its proprietary delivery technologies and other manufacturing services for commercial partners who commercialize or plan to commercialize these products. These collaborations can result in revenue streams including royalties, profit sharing, research and development and manufacturing fees, which support continued operations for its CDMO division and it contributes non-dilutive funding for the development and pre-commercialization activities of its Acute Care division.

2017-08-21,IRWD,https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Ironwood+Pharma+%28IRWD%29+Announces+FDA+Approval+of+DUZALLO+for+Treatment+of+Hyperuricemia+in+Patients+with+Uncontrolled+Gout/13222622.html,,"Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IRWD) today announced DUZALLO was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a once-daily oral treatment for hyperuricemia associated with gout in patients who have not achieved target serum uric acid (sUA) levels with a medically appropriate daily dose of allopurinol alone. DUZALLO is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Ironwood expects DUZALLO to be commercially available early in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Gout is a highly symptomatic and painful form of inflammatory arthritis caused by hyperuricemia, or elevated sUA levels in the blood, which can lead to painful flares and serious potential long-term health consequences.DUZALLO is the first drug that combines the current standard of care for the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout, allopurinol, with the most recent FDA-approved treatment for this condition, lesinurad. This fixed-dose combination provides a dual mechanism of action in a single tablet that can address both underlying causes of hyperuricemia – overproduction and underexcretion of serum uric acid.

“The approval of DUZALLO provides a new fixed-dose and dual-mechanism treatment option to help patients with uncontrolled gout achieve target serum uric acid levels. This represents an important and needed new option in the treatment of hyperuricemia,” said Michael A. Becker, M.D., professor emeritus of medicine, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL. “Gout is a serious and potentially progressive and debilitating inflammatory disease. Getting patients with gout to serum urate goal, and keeping them at or below goal, are essential to success in treating these patients. DUZALLO will help reduce the significant unmet need among patients in the U.S. who fail to get their serum uric acid levels to goal despite taking allopurinol alone.”

“With DUZALLO, nearly twice as many patients with uncontrolled gout may be able to achieve target serum uric acid levels compared to those patients taking allopurinol alone, which is important, considering the significant unmet need among uncontrolled gout patients to get to goal of under 6 mg/dL,” said Tom McCourt, senior vice president of marketing and sales and chief commercial officer at Ironwood. “We believe DUZALLO will be the critical driver behind Ironwood’s gout franchise, which is expected to exceed total annual U.S. peak sales of $300 million.”",L,
2017-08-21,NVO,https://www.gurufocus.com/news/556495/3-companies-aiming-to-significantly-reduce-diabetes-treatment-costs,,"Total U.S. health care spending in 2015 was an astronomical $3.2 trillion. That is 16% of the entire national debt. As much as we blame the prices of new drugs for this gargantuan sum, one of the biggest chunks of it comes from diabetes, a disease whose treatment has not changed all that much since 1922. According to the American Diabetes Association, diabetes accounts for $322 billion in total U.S. health care spending as of 2016.

One Harvard study puts the annual cost at a much higher $822 billion annually. Whichever number you want to believe, it is among the costliest diseases in the world, for both patients and taxpayers. Thanks to Medicare and Medicaid, diabetes costs are socialized.



There are two reasons for the rising costs. First, the price of insulin has tripled since 2002. Second, the nature of lifetime treatment necessitates ever-rising doses of insulin as the disease progresses.

Short of hoping Americans radically change their diets overnight and drastically reduce sugar intake, the problem is not going away. But there is hope for significant cost reduction nonetheless. Here are three companies on the cutting edge of the newest diabetes advancements that, with some luck, may help reduce this nearly unfathomable cost to the U.S. economy and taxpayers.

Novo Nordisk and semaglutide

Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) recently announced its once-weekly GLP-1 agonist semaglutide handily beat Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide in terms of weight loss and blood sugar control in a pivotal Phase III trial. GLP-1 agonists, unlike insulin, stimulate pancreatic cells to produce insulin in a glucose-dependent manner. Meaning, GLP-1 agonists only induce native insulin production when blood glucose levels are high enough to trigger it. This is much more convenient than manually measuring blood sugar before injecting insulin directly.

While markets are focused on the one-on-one beat, raising Novo shares at the expense of Eli Lilly’s, there is potentially more exciting news regarding semaglutide yet to come. Novo Nordisk has already demonstrated in a Phase II trial that an oral formulation of semaglutide can work as well. If this continues into Phase III, the implication could be big for diabetes treatment costs. Oral formulations of otherwise intravenous drugs increase patient compliance and, if it works better than GLP-1 agonists currently on the market, it could keep diabetes patients healthier for longer, reducing long-run costs as the disease progresses, by far the costliest aspect of diabetes.

Roche and the artificial pancreas

Another innovative way to increase patient compliance and reduce long-run costs is to simply automate everything. Roche Holding AG (RHHBY) is currently sponsoring a late-stage development of an artificial pancreas that uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology together with an insulin pump to keep diabetics’ blood sugar in perpetual balance.

A pivotal Phase III trial was announced late last month, cosponsored by Roche Diabetics Care Inc. The ingenious closed-loop system uses a smartphone app to notify patients when blood sugar levels go out of range of preset limits. Since most of the damage from diabetes occurs when patients are out of their blood sugar target ranges, by keeping diabetics range-bound for longer, and hopefully perpetually, much of the cumulative damage from diabetes can hopefully be blunted or maybe even prevented for the long run. This closed-loop artificial pancreas is currently intended for Type 1 diabetics, though if successful it may be trialed for the much more prevalent Type 2 population.

Oramed and oral insulin

Perhaps the most ambitious of new diabetes treatments is an oral insulin formulation from Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ORMP). Oramed just recently announced a planned Phase III trial for what has been termed the holy grail of diabetes treatments.

Oral insulin could fundamentally change the entire diabetes playing field since it would change the way insulin interacts with blood glucose and make the process more akin to what occurs in healthy people. Oramed is using similar technology to what Novo Nordisk is using in its own oral GLP-1 treatment, so there is reason to believe it could actually work.

Oral insulin could get prediabetics on insulin earlier since injecting insulin daily is not only inconvenient but almost taboo and a last resort. Getting prediabetics on insulin faster could go a long way in reducing late-stage complications as the disease progresses and insulin resistance sets in.

There is reason to believe insulin resistance – the factor that necessitates ever-higher doses of insulin and where most of the costs lay - will be less of a problem with an oral formulation because oral insulin goes through the liver, which is the natural organ for regulating insulin release once it receives it from the pancreas. It is a way of having the body naturally regulate insulin release rather than having to measure the dose via blood sugar analysis constantly.

All or any success amongst these three companies could take a significant bite out of overall diabetes costs over the next decade and beyond. Diabetes is by far the costliest health care niche and badly in need of a major advance. With three companies with potentially paradigm-shifting treatments in the pipe, chances are we will see that major advance before the close of this decade and before diabetes costs spiral completely out of control, if they have not done so already.",L,

Oramed is using similar technology to what Novo Nordisk is using in its own oral GLP-1 treatment, so there is reason to believe it could actually work.

Oral insulin could get prediabetics on insulin earlier since injecting insulin daily is not only inconvenient but almost taboo and a last resort. Getting prediabetics on insulin faster could go a long way in reducing late-stage complications as the disease progresses and insulin resistance sets in.

There is reason to believe insulin resistance – the factor that necessitates ever-higher doses of insulin and where most of the costs lay - will be less of a problem with an oral formulation because oral insulin goes through the liver, which is the natural organ for regulating insulin release once it receives it from the pancreas. It is a way of having the body naturally regulate insulin release rather than having to measure the dose via blood sugar analysis constantly.

All or any success amongst these three companies could take a significant bite out of overall diabetes costs over the next decade and beyond. Diabetes is by far the costliest health care niche and badly in need of a major advance. With three companies with potentially paradigm-shifting treatments in the pipe, chances are we will see that major advance before the close of this decade and before diabetes costs spiral completely out of control, if they have not done so already.",L,

2017-08-21,BMY,https://www.mesotheliomahelp.org/2017/08/results-opdivo-trial-may-help-mesothelioma-oncologists-identify-patients-will-benefit-drug/,,"In April, MesotheliomaHelp reported on the findings of a phase I clinical trial showing that the five-year survival rate for some lung cancer patients treated with Opdivo (nivolumab), an immunotherapy treatment, was “much higher” than historical data. Now, researchers report that results from a phase III clinical trial may help oncologists determine those lung cancer patients, and possibly, mesothelioma patients, who will benefit from the immuno-oncology drug.

Opdivo, developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, works by blocking the PD-L1 protein and activating the immune system, leading it to attack and kill cancer cells. According to a June 21 press release from The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, a team of researchers led by David Carbone, MD, PhD, of The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer – Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute, found that although the trial did not improve progression-free survival when compared with chemotherapy in the overall population, those patients with a high expression of PD-L1 did benefit.

“The good news is that we discovered that a subset of patients who had both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status did experience a significant benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

Specifically, the researchers report that patients who had “both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status” realized a 75 percent response rate compared to just 16 percent response rate with low mutation burden and low PDL-1. However, the response rates for chemotherapy treatment in these same subsets were nearly the same leading the researchers to conclude that the PDL-1 markers “were selective for immunotherapy.”

Mesothelioma, a rare, asbestos-related cancer of the lining of the lungs, abdomen or heart, is highly aggressive and is resistant to many cancer treatments. The prognosis for mesothelioma patients is usually grim: the average survival time varies from 4 – 18 months after diagnosis. For the close to 3,000 Americans diagnosed with the disease each year, personalized care may bring a breakthrough treatment not previously considered by their physician.

The benefits of personalized care for mesothelioma patients have been proven where researchers have identified genetic biomarkers that reflect the aggressiveness of mesothelioma as well as markers that can assess the effectiveness of a particular treatment.

Opdivo is currently in a phase III clinical trial in the UK for mesothelioma patients. Known as The CheckpOiNt Blockade For Inhibition of Relapsed Mesothelioma, or CONIFRM, the trial has a goal of ‘exploiting the potential of immunotherapy.’

Keytruda, which gained popularity after saving former President Jimmy Carter’s life after sending his melanoma into remission, is also a PD-L1 inhibitor. Both immunotherapy drugs have shown in studies to be effective in fighting pleural mesothelioma. Keytruda is, perhaps, more well known due to eight-year mesothelioma survivor Mavis Nye of England, who went into remission after a two-year clinical trial of the drug.

“This study is an important step toward understanding the impact of tumor mutation burden and PDL-1 in immunotherapy response. This data shows we should evaluate these two factors independently to most accurately define who will benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

About Recro Pharma, Inc.

Recro is a specialty pharmaceutical company that operates through two business divisions, an Acute Care, hospital product division and a revenue-generating contract development and manufacturing, or CDMO division, located at the Company's Gainesville facility. The Acute Care division is primarily focused on developing innovative products for hospital and other acute care settings. The Company's lead product candidate is a proprietary injectable form of meloxicam, a long-acting preferential COX-2 inhibitor. IV meloxicam 30mg has successfully completed two pivotal Phase III clinical efficacy trials in patients following bunionectomy and abdominoplasty surgeries, a large double blind Phase III safety trial, four Phase II clinical trials for the management of moderate to severe post-operative pain, as well as other safety studies. As injectable meloxicam is in the non-opioid class of drugs, the Company believes it will overcome many of the issues associated with commonly prescribed opioid therapeutics, including respiratory depression, constipation, excessive nausea and vomiting, as well as having no addictive potential while maintaining meaningful analgesic effects for relief of pain. The Company's CDMO division leverages its formulation expertise to develop and manufacture pharmaceutical products using its proprietary delivery technologies and other manufacturing services for commercial partners who commercialize or plan to commercialize these products. These collaborations can result in revenue streams including royalties, profit sharing, research and development and manufacturing fees, which support continued operations for its CDMO division and it contributes non-dilutive funding for the development and pre-commercialization activities of its Acute Care division.

2017-08-21,IRWD,https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Ironwood+Pharma+%28IRWD%29+Announces+FDA+Approval+of+DUZALLO+for+Treatment+of+Hyperuricemia+in+Patients+with+Uncontrolled+Gout/13222622.html,,"Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IRWD) today announced DUZALLO was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a once-daily oral treatment for hyperuricemia associated with gout in patients who have not achieved target serum uric acid (sUA) levels with a medically appropriate daily dose of allopurinol alone. DUZALLO is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Ironwood expects DUZALLO to be commercially available early in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Gout is a highly symptomatic and painful form of inflammatory arthritis caused by hyperuricemia, or elevated sUA levels in the blood, which can lead to painful flares and serious potential long-term health consequences.DUZALLO is the first drug that combines the current standard of care for the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout, allopurinol, with the most recent FDA-approved treatment for this condition, lesinurad. This fixed-dose combination provides a dual mechanism of action in a single tablet that can address both underlying causes of hyperuricemia – overproduction and underexcretion of serum uric acid.

“The approval of DUZALLO provides a new fixed-dose and dual-mechanism treatment option to help patients with uncontrolled gout achieve target serum uric acid levels. This represents an important and needed new option in the treatment of hyperuricemia,” said Michael A. Becker, M.D., professor emeritus of medicine, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL. “Gout is a serious and potentially progressive and debilitating inflammatory disease. Getting patients with gout to serum urate goal, and keeping them at or below goal, are essential to success in treating these patients. DUZALLO will help reduce the significant unmet need among patients in the U.S. who fail to get their serum uric acid levels to goal despite taking allopurinol alone.”

“With DUZALLO, nearly twice as many patients with uncontrolled gout may be able to achieve target serum uric acid levels compared to those patients taking allopurinol alone, which is important, considering the significant unmet need among uncontrolled gout patients to get to goal of under 6 mg/dL,” said Tom McCourt, senior vice president of marketing and sales and chief commercial officer at Ironwood. “We believe DUZALLO will be the critical driver behind Ironwood’s gout franchise, which is expected to exceed total annual U.S. peak sales of $300 million.”",L,-2.6507620941020567

That is 16% of the entire national debt. As much as we blame the prices of new drugs for this gargantuan sum, one of the biggest chunks of it comes from diabetes, a disease whose treatment has not changed all that much since 1922. According to the American Diabetes Association, diabetes accounts for $322 billion in total U.S. health care spending as of 2016.

One Harvard study puts the annual cost at a much higher $822 billion annually. Whichever number you want to believe, it is among the costliest diseases in the world, for both patients and taxpayers. Thanks to Medicare and Medicaid, diabetes costs are socialized.



There are two reasons for the rising costs. First, the price of insulin has tripled since 2002. Second, the nature of lifetime treatment necessitates ever-rising doses of insulin as the disease progresses.

Short of hoping Americans radically change their diets overnight and drastically reduce sugar intake, the problem is not going away. But there is hope for significant cost reduction nonetheless.

Novo Nordisk and semaglutide

Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) recently announced its once-weekly GLP-1 agonist semaglutide handily beat Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide in terms of weight loss and blood sugar control in a pivotal Phase III trial. GLP-1 agonists, unlike insulin, stimulate pancreatic cells to produce insulin in a glucose-dependent manner. Meaning, GLP-1 agonists only induce native insulin production when blood glucose levels are high enough to trigger it. This is much more convenient than manually measuring blood sugar before injecting insulin directly.

While markets are focused on the one-on-one beat, raising Novo shares at the expense of Eli Lilly’s, there is potentially more exciting news regarding semaglutide yet to come. Novo Nordisk has already demonstrated in a Phase II trial that an oral formulation of semaglutide can work as well. If this continues into Phase III, the implication could be big for diabetes treatment costs. Oral formulations of otherwise intravenous drugs increase patient compliance and, if it works better than GLP-1 agonists currently on the market, it could keep diabetes patients healthier for longer, reducing long-run costs as the disease progresses, by far the costliest aspect of diabetes.

Roche and the artificial pancreas

Another innovative way to increase patient compliance and reduce long-run costs is to simply automate everything. Roche Holding AG (RHHBY) is currently sponsoring a late-stage development of an artificial pancreas that uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology together with an insulin pump to keep diabetics’ blood sugar in perpetual balance.

A pivotal Phase III trial was announced late last month, cosponsored by Roche Diabetics Care Inc. The ingenious closed-loop system uses a smartphone app to notify patients when blood sugar levels go out of range of preset limits. Since most of the damage from diabetes occurs when patients are out of their blood sugar target ranges, by keeping diabetics range-bound for longer, and hopefully perpetually, much of the cumulative damage from diabetes can hopefully be blunted or maybe even prevented for the long run. This closed-loop artificial pancreas is currently intended for Type 1 diabetics, though if successful it may be trialed for the much more prevalent Type 2 population.

Oral insulin could fundamentally change the entire diabetes playing field since it would change the way insulin interacts with blood glucose and make the process more akin to what occurs in healthy people. Oramed is using similar technology to what Novo Nordisk is using in its own oral GLP-1 treatment, so there is reason to believe it could actually work.

Oral insulin could get prediabetics on insulin earlier since injecting insulin daily is not only inconvenient but almost taboo and a last resort. Getting prediabetics on insulin faster could go a long way in reducing late-stage complications as the disease progresses and insulin resistance sets in.

There is reason to believe insulin resistance – the factor that necessitates ever-higher doses of insulin and where most of the costs lay - will be less of a problem with an oral formulation because oral insulin goes through the liver, which is the natural organ for regulating insulin release once it receives it from the pancreas. It is a way of having the body naturally regulate insulin release rather than having to measure the dose via blood sugar analysis constantly.

All or any success amongst these three companies could take a significant bite out of overall diabetes costs over the next decade and beyond. Diabetes is by far the costliest health care niche and badly in need of a major advance. With three companies with potentially paradigm-shifting treatments in the pipe, chances are we will see that major advance before the close of this decade and before diabetes costs spiral completely out of control, if they have not done so already.",L,-2.1039603960396032
2017-08-21,LLY,https://www.gurufocus.com/news/556495/3-companies-aiming-to-significantly-reduce-diabetes-treatment-costs,,"Total U.S. health care spending in 2015 was an astronomical $3.2 trillion. That is 16% of the entire national debt. As much as we blame the prices of new drugs for this gargantuan sum, one of the biggest chunks of it comes from diabetes, a disease whose treatment has not changed all that much since 1922. According to the American Diabetes Association, diabetes accounts for $322 billion in total U.S. health care spending as of 2016.

One Harvard study puts the annual cost at a much higher $822 billion annually. Whichever number you want to believe, it is among the costliest diseases in the world, for both patients and taxpayers. Thanks to Medicare and Medicaid, diabetes costs are socialized.



There are two reasons for the rising costs. First, the price of insulin has tripled since 2002. Second, the nature of lifetime treatment necessitates ever-rising doses of insulin as the disease progresses.

Short of hoping Americans radically change their diets overnight and drastically reduce sugar intake, the problem is not going away. But there is hope for significant cost reduction nonetheless. Here are three companies on the cutting edge of the newest diabetes advancements that, with some luck, may help reduce this nearly unfathomable cost to the U.S. economy and taxpayers.

Novo Nordisk and semaglutide

Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) recently announced its once-weekly GLP-1 agonist semaglutide handily beat Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide in terms of weight loss and blood sugar control in a pivotal Phase III trial. GLP-1 agonists, unlike insulin, stimulate pancreatic cells to produce insulin in a glucose-dependent manner. Meaning, GLP-1 agonists only induce native insulin production when blood glucose levels are high enough to trigger it. This is much more convenient than manually measuring blood sugar before injecting insulin directly.

While markets are focused on the one-on-one beat, raising Novo shares at the expense of Eli Lilly’s, there is potentially more exciting news regarding semaglutide yet to come. Novo Nordisk has already demonstrated in a Phase II trial that an oral formulation of semaglutide can work as well. If this continues into Phase III, the implication could be big for diabetes treatment costs. Oral formulations of otherwise intravenous drugs increase patient compliance and, if it works better than GLP-1 agonists currently on the market, it could keep diabetes patients healthier for longer, reducing long-run costs as the disease progresses, by far the costliest aspect of diabetes.

Roche and the artificial pancreas

Another innovative way to increase patient compliance and reduce long-run costs is to simply automate everything. Roche Holding AG (RHHBY) is currently sponsoring a late-stage development of an artificial pancreas that uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology together with an insulin pump to keep diabetics’ blood sugar in perpetual balance.

A pivotal Phase III trial was announced late last month, cosponsored by Roche Diabetics Care Inc. The ingenious closed-loop system uses a smartphone app to notify patients when blood sugar levels go out of range of preset limits. Since most of the damage from diabetes occurs when patients are out of their blood sugar target ranges, by keeping diabetics range-bound for longer, and hopefully perpetually, much of the cumulative damage from diabetes can hopefully be blunted or maybe even prevented for the long run. This closed-loop artificial pancreas is currently intended for Type 1 diabetics, though if successful it may be trialed for the much more prevalent Type 2 population.

2017-08-21,BMY,https://www.mesotheliomahelp.org/2017/08/results-opdivo-trial-may-help-mesothelioma-oncologists-identify-patients-will-benefit-drug/,,"In April, MesotheliomaHelp reported on the findings of a phase I clinical trial showing that the five-year survival rate for some lung cancer patients treated with Opdivo (nivolumab), an immunotherapy treatment, was “much higher” than historical data. Now, researchers report that results from a phase III clinical trial may help oncologists determine those lung cancer patients, and possibly, mesothelioma patients, who will benefit from the immuno-oncology drug.

Opdivo, developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, works by blocking the PD-L1 protein and activating the immune system, leading it to attack and kill cancer cells. According to a June 21 press release from The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, a team of researchers led by David Carbone, MD, PhD, of The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer – Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute, found that although the trial did not improve progression-free survival when compared with chemotherapy in the overall population, those patients with a high expression of PD-L1 did benefit.

“The good news is that we discovered that a subset of patients who had both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status did experience a significant benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

Specifically, the researchers report that patients who had “both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status” realized a 75 percent response rate compared to just 16 percent response rate with low mutation burden and low PDL-1. However, the response rates for chemotherapy treatment in these same subsets were nearly the same leading the researchers to conclude that the PDL-1 markers “were selective for immunotherapy.”

Mesothelioma, a rare, asbestos-related cancer of the lining of the lungs, abdomen or heart, is highly aggressive and is resistant to many cancer treatments. The prognosis for mesothelioma patients is usually grim: the average survival time varies from 4 – 18 months after diagnosis. For the close to 3,000 Americans diagnosed with the disease each year, personalized care may bring a breakthrough treatment not previously considered by their physician.

The benefits of personalized care for mesothelioma patients have been proven where researchers have identified genetic biomarkers that reflect the aggressiveness of mesothelioma as well as markers that can assess the effectiveness of a particular treatment.

Opdivo is currently in a phase III clinical trial in the UK for mesothelioma patients. Known as The CheckpOiNt Blockade For Inhibition of Relapsed Mesothelioma, or CONIFRM, the trial has a goal of ‘exploiting the potential of immunotherapy.’

Keytruda, which gained popularity after saving former President Jimmy Carter’s life after sending his melanoma into remission, is also a PD-L1 inhibitor. Both immunotherapy drugs have shown in studies to be effective in fighting pleural mesothelioma. Keytruda is, perhaps, more well known due to eight-year mesothelioma survivor Mavis Nye of England, who went into remission after a two-year clinical trial of the drug.

“This study is an important step toward understanding the impact of tumor mutation burden and PDL-1 in immunotherapy response. This data shows we should evaluate these two factors independently to most accurately define who will benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

About Recro Pharma, Inc.

Recro is a specialty pharmaceutical company that operates through two business divisions, an Acute Care, hospital product division and a revenue-generating contract development and manufacturing, or CDMO division, located at the Company's Gainesville facility. The Acute Care division is primarily focused on developing innovative products for hospital and other acute care settings. The Company's lead product candidate is a proprietary injectable form of meloxicam, a long-acting preferential COX-2 inhibitor. IV meloxicam 30mg has successfully completed two pivotal Phase III clinical efficacy trials in patients following bunionectomy and abdominoplasty surgeries, a large double blind Phase III safety trial, four Phase II clinical trials for the management of moderate to severe post-operative pain, as well as other safety studies. As injectable meloxicam is in the non-opioid class of drugs, the Company believes it will overcome many of the issues associated with commonly prescribed opioid therapeutics, including respiratory depression, constipation, excessive nausea and vomiting, as well as having no addictive potential while maintaining meaningful analgesic effects for relief of pain. The Company's CDMO division leverages its formulation expertise to develop and manufacture pharmaceutical products using its proprietary delivery technologies and other manufacturing services for commercial partners who commercialize or plan to commercialize these products. These collaborations can result in revenue streams including royalties, profit sharing, research and development and manufacturing fees, which support continued operations for its CDMO division and it contributes non-dilutive funding for the development and pre-commercialization activities of its Acute Care division.

2017-08-21,IRWD,https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Ironwood+Pharma+%28IRWD%29+Announces+FDA+Approval+of+DUZALLO+for+Treatment+of+Hyperuricemia+in+Patients+with+Uncontrolled+Gout/13222622.html,,"Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IRWD) today announced DUZALLO was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a once-daily oral treatment for hyperuricemia associated with gout in patients who have not achieved target serum uric acid (sUA) levels with a medically appropriate daily dose of allopurinol alone. DUZALLO is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Ironwood expects DUZALLO to be commercially available early in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Gout is a highly symptomatic and painful form of inflammatory arthritis caused by hyperuricemia, or elevated sUA levels in the blood, which can lead to painful flares and serious potential long-term health consequences.DUZALLO is the first drug that combines the current standard of care for the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout, allopurinol, with the most recent FDA-approved treatment for this condition, lesinurad. This fixed-dose combination provides a dual mechanism of action in a single tablet that can address both underlying causes of hyperuricemia – overproduction and underexcretion of serum uric acid.

“The approval of DUZALLO provides a new fixed-dose and dual-mechanism treatment option to help patients with uncontrolled gout achieve target serum uric acid levels. This represents an important and needed new option in the treatment of hyperuricemia,” said Michael A. Becker, M.D., professor emeritus of medicine, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL. “Gout is a serious and potentially progressive and debilitating inflammatory disease. Getting patients with gout to serum urate goal, and keeping them at or below goal, are essential to success in treating these patients. DUZALLO will help reduce the significant unmet need among patients in the U.S. who fail to get their serum uric acid levels to goal despite taking allopurinol alone.”

“With DUZALLO, nearly twice as many patients with uncontrolled gout may be able to achieve target serum uric acid levels compared to those patients taking allopurinol alone, which is important, considering the significant unmet need among uncontrolled gout patients to get to goal of under 6 mg/dL,” said Tom McCourt, senior vice president of marketing and sales and chief commercial officer at Ironwood. “We believe DUZALLO will be the critical driver behind Ironwood’s gout franchise, which is expected to exceed total annual U.S. peak sales of $300 million.”",L,-2.65

Oral insulin could fundamentally change the entire diabetes playing field since it would change the way insulin interacts with blood glucose and make the process more akin to what occurs in healthy people. Oramed is using similar technology to what Novo Nordisk is using in its own oral GLP-1 treatment, so there is reason to believe it could actually work.

Oral insulin could get prediabetics on insulin earlier since injecting insulin daily is not only inconvenient but almost taboo and a last resort. Getting prediabetics on insulin faster could go a long way in reducing late-stage complications as the disease progresses and insulin resistance sets in.

There is reason to believe insulin resistance – the factor that necessitates ever-higher doses of insulin and where most of the costs lay - will be less of a problem with an oral formulation because oral insulin goes through the liver, which is the natural organ for regulating insulin release once it receives it from the pancreas. It is a way of having the body naturally regulate insulin release rather than having to measure the dose via blood sugar analysis constantly.

All or any success amongst these three companies could take a significant bite out of overall diabetes costs over the next decade and beyond. Diabetes is by far the costliest health care niche and badly in need of a major advance. With three companies with potentially paradigm-shifting treatments in the pipe, chances are we will see that major advance before the close of this decade and before diabetes costs spiral completely out of control, if they have not done so already.",L,-1.05

Novo Nordisk and semaglutide

Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) recently announced its once-weekly GLP-1 agonist semaglutide handily beat Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide in terms of weight loss and blood sugar control in a pivotal Phase III trial. GLP-1 agonists, unlike insulin, stimulate pancreatic cells to produce insulin in a glucose-dependent manner. Meaning, GLP-1 agonists only induce native insulin production when blood glucose levels are high enough to trigger it. This is much more convenient than manually measuring blood sugar before injecting insulin directly.

While markets are focused on the one-on-one beat, raising Novo shares at the expense of Eli Lilly’s, there is potentially more exciting news regarding semaglutide yet to come. Novo Nordisk has already demonstrated in a Phase II trial that an oral formulation of semaglutide can work as well. If this continues into Phase III, the implication could be big for diabetes treatment costs. Oral formulations of otherwise intravenous drugs increase patient compliance and, if it works better than GLP-1 agonists currently on the market, it could keep diabetes patients healthier for longer, reducing long-run costs as the disease progresses, by far the costliest aspect of diabetes.

Roche and the artificial pancreas

Another innovative way to increase patient compliance and reduce long-run costs is to simply automate everything. Roche Holding AG (RHHBY) is currently sponsoring a late-stage development of an artificial pancreas that uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology together with an insulin pump to keep diabetics’ blood sugar in perpetual balance.

A pivotal Phase III trial was announced late last month, cosponsored by Roche Diabetics Care Inc. The ingenious closed-loop system uses a smartphone app to notify patients when blood sugar levels go out of range of preset limits. Since most of the damage from diabetes occurs when patients are out of their blood sugar target ranges, by keeping diabetics range-bound for longer, and hopefully perpetually, much of the cumulative damage from diabetes can hopefully be blunted or maybe even prevented for the long run. This closed-loop artificial pancreas is currently intended for Type 1 diabetics, though if successful it may be trialed for the much more prevalent Type 2 population.

2017-08-21,BMY,https://www.mesotheliomahelp.org/2017/08/results-opdivo-trial-may-help-mesothelioma-oncologists-identify-patients-will-benefit-drug/,,"In April, MesotheliomaHelp reported on the findings of a phase I clinical trial showing that the five-year survival rate for some lung cancer patients treated with Opdivo (nivolumab), an immunotherapy treatment, was “much higher” than historical data. Now, researchers report that results from a phase III clinical trial may help oncologists determine those lung cancer patients, and possibly, mesothelioma patients, who will benefit from the immuno-oncology drug.

Opdivo, developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, works by blocking the PD-L1 protein and activating the immune system, leading it to attack and kill cancer cells. According to a June 21 press release from The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, a team of researchers led by David Carbone, MD, PhD, of The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer – Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute, found that although the trial did not improve progression-free survival when compared with chemotherapy in the overall population, those patients with a high expression of PD-L1 did benefit.

“The good news is that we discovered that a subset of patients who had both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status did experience a significant benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

Specifically, the researchers report that patients who had “both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status” realized a 75 percent response rate compared to just 16 percent response rate with low mutation burden and low PDL-1. However, the response rates for chemotherapy treatment in these same subsets were nearly the same leading the researchers to conclude that the PDL-1 markers “were selective for immunotherapy.”

Mesothelioma, a rare, asbestos-related cancer of the lining of the lungs, abdomen or heart, is highly aggressive and is resistant to many cancer treatments. The prognosis for mesothelioma patients is usually grim: the average survival time varies from 4 – 18 months after diagnosis. For the close to 3,000 Americans diagnosed with the disease each year, personalized care may bring a breakthrough treatment not previously considered by their physician.

The benefits of personalized care for mesothelioma patients have been proven where researchers have identified genetic biomarkers that reflect the aggressiveness of mesothelioma as well as markers that can assess the effectiveness of a particular treatment.

Opdivo is currently in a phase III clinical trial in the UK for mesothelioma patients. Known as The CheckpOiNt Blockade For Inhibition of Relapsed Mesothelioma, or CONIFRM, the trial has a goal of ‘exploiting the potential of immunotherapy.’

Keytruda, which gained popularity after saving former President Jimmy Carter’s life after sending his melanoma into remission, is also a PD-L1 inhibitor. Both immunotherapy drugs have shown in studies to be effective in fighting pleural mesothelioma. Keytruda is, perhaps, more well known due to eight-year mesothelioma survivor Mavis Nye of England, who went into remission after a two-year clinical trial of the drug.

“This study is an important step toward understanding the impact of tumor mutation burden and PDL-1 in immunotherapy response. This data shows we should evaluate these two factors independently to most accurately define who will benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

About Recro Pharma, Inc.

Recro is a specialty pharmaceutical company that operates through two business divisions, an Acute Care, hospital product division and a revenue-generating contract development and manufacturing, or CDMO division, located at the Company's Gainesville facility. The Acute Care division is primarily focused on developing innovative products for hospital and other acute care settings. The Company's lead product candidate is a proprietary injectable form of meloxicam, a long-acting preferential COX-2 inhibitor. IV meloxicam 30mg has successfully completed two pivotal Phase III clinical efficacy trials in patients following bunionectomy and abdominoplasty surgeries, a large double blind Phase III safety trial, four Phase II clinical trials for the management of moderate to severe post-operative pain, as well as other safety studies. As injectable meloxicam is in the non-opioid class of drugs, the Company believes it will overcome many of the issues associated with commonly prescribed opioid therapeutics, including respiratory depression, constipation, excessive nausea and vomiting, as well as having no addictive potential while maintaining meaningful analgesic effects for relief of pain. The Company's CDMO division leverages its formulation expertise to develop and manufacture pharmaceutical products using its proprietary delivery technologies and other manufacturing services for commercial partners who commercialize or plan to commercialize these products. These collaborations can result in revenue streams including royalties, profit sharing, research and development and manufacturing fees, which support continued operations for its CDMO division and it contributes non-dilutive funding for the development and pre-commercialization activities of its Acute Care division.

(NASDAQ: IRWD) today announced DUZALLO was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a once-daily oral treatment for hyperuricemia associated with gout in patients who have not achieved target serum uric acid (sUA) levels with a medically appropriate daily dose of allopurinol alone. DUZALLO is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Ironwood expects DUZALLO to be commercially available early in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Gout is a highly symptomatic and painful form of inflammatory arthritis caused by hyperuricemia, or elevated sUA levels in the blood, which can lead to painful flares and serious potential long-term health consequences.DUZALLO is the first drug that combines the current standard of care for the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout, allopurinol, with the most recent FDA-approved treatment for this condition, lesinurad. This fixed-dose combination provides a dual mechanism of action in a single tablet that can address both underlying causes of hyperuricemia – overproduction and underexcretion of serum uric acid.

“The approval of DUZALLO provides a new fixed-dose and dual-mechanism treatment option to help patients with uncontrolled gout achieve target serum uric acid levels. This represents an important and needed new option in the treatment of hyperuricemia,” said Michael A. Becker, M.D., professor emeritus of medicine, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL. “Gout is a serious and potentially progressive and debilitating inflammatory disease. Getting patients with gout to serum urate goal, and keeping them at or below goal, are essential to success in treating these patients. DUZALLO will help reduce the significant unmet need among patients in the U.S. who fail to get their serum uric acid levels to goal despite taking allopurinol alone.”

“With DUZALLO, nearly twice as many patients with uncontrolled gout may be able to achieve target serum uric acid levels compared to those patients taking allopurinol alone, which is important, considering the significant unmet need among uncontrolled gout patients to get to goal of under 6 mg/dL,” said Tom McCourt, senior vice president of marketing and sales and chief commercial officer at Ironwood. “We believe DUZALLO will be the critical driver behind Ironwood’s gout franchise, which is expected to exceed total annual U.S. peak sales of $300 million.”",L,-2.65

Oral insulin could fundamentally change the entire diabetes playing field since it would change the way insulin interacts with blood glucose and make the process more akin to what occurs in healthy people. Oramed is using similar technology to what Novo Nordisk is using in its own oral GLP-1 treatment, so there is reason to believe it could actually work.

Oral insulin could get prediabetics on insulin earlier since injecting insulin daily is not only inconvenient but almost taboo and a last resort. Getting prediabetics on insulin faster could go a long way in reducing late-stage complications as the disease progresses and insulin resistance sets in.

There is reason to believe insulin resistance – the factor that necessitates ever-higher doses of insulin and where most of the costs lay - will be less of a problem with an oral formulation because oral insulin goes through the liver, which is the natural organ for regulating insulin release once it receives it from the pancreas. It is a way of having the body naturally regulate insulin release rather than having to measure the dose via blood sugar analysis constantly.

Diabetes is by far the costliest health care niche and badly in need of a major advance.

Novo Nordisk and semaglutide

Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) recently announced its once-weekly GLP-1 agonist semaglutide handily beat Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide in terms of weight loss and blood sugar control in a pivotal Phase III trial. GLP-1 agonists, unlike insulin, stimulate pancreatic cells to produce insulin in a glucose-dependent manner. Meaning, GLP-1 agonists only induce native insulin production when blood glucose levels are high enough to trigger it. This is much more convenient than manually measuring blood sugar before injecting insulin directly.

While markets are focused on the one-on-one beat, raising Novo shares at the expense of Eli Lilly’s, there is potentially more exciting news regarding semaglutide yet to come. Novo Nordisk has already demonstrated in a Phase II trial that an oral formulation of semaglutide can work as well. If this continues into Phase III, the implication could be big for diabetes treatment costs. Oral formulations of otherwise intravenous drugs increase patient compliance and, if it works better than GLP-1 agonists currently on the market, it could keep diabetes patients healthier for longer, reducing long-run costs as the disease progresses, by far the costliest aspect of diabetes.

Roche and the artificial pancreas

Another innovative way to increase patient compliance and reduce long-run costs is to simply automate everything. Roche Holding AG (RHHBY) is currently sponsoring a late-stage development of an artificial pancreas that uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology together with an insulin pump to keep diabetics’ blood sugar in perpetual balance.

A pivotal Phase III trial was announced late last month, cosponsored by Roche Diabetics Care Inc. The ingenious closed-loop system uses a smartphone app to notify patients when blood sugar levels go out of range of preset limits. Since most of the damage from diabetes occurs when patients are out of their blood sugar target ranges, by keeping diabetics range-bound for longer, and hopefully perpetually, much of the cumulative damage from diabetes can hopefully be blunted or maybe even prevented for the long run. This closed-loop artificial pancreas is currently intended for Type 1 diabetics, though if successful it may be trialed for the much more prevalent Type 2 population.

Oramed and oral insulin

Perhaps the most ambitious of new diabetes treatments is an oral insulin formulation from Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ORMP). Oramed just recently announced a planned Phase III trial for what has been termed the holy grail of diabetes treatments.

After all, excluding the effects of destocking, even neuroscience had seen growth.

As we will see, however, Shire is certainly facing intense competition in some of its core areas. Yet, its success in fresh R&D results, combined with current and potential corporate level changes, suggests Shire is being undervalued right now. For long-term investors, today's somewhat subdued share price seems an ideal opportunity to buy into an increasingly compelling growth story coming from the world’s global leader in rare diseases.

A Hematology Hiatus Coming?

First off, we need to reflect a little on one of the main drivers of Shire’s share price weakness. Chiefly, this has surrounded increasing potential competition in some of its core franchises. This is especially true in its hematology franchise. Picked up as part of its Baxalta acquisition in 2016, it is now the largest revenue generator in the company. Yet, investors are getting a little nervous about potential threats in this area.

The subject has been more thoroughly explored by HealthBlogger last month. Shire has, however, a leading market position in the hematology market. Its ADVATE and ADYNOVATE are approved for use in the treatment of hemophilia without inhibitor (that is, for those patients who have not developed Factor VIII inhibitors). Indeed, ADVATE is the top Factor VIII brand with proven efficacy in the market. Similarly, for those who have developed Factor VIII inhibitors, Shire markets FEIBA which is an anti-inhibitor coagulant or bypassing agent. For Shire, this latter area contributes about 23% of total hematology revenue with the former contributing the lion’s share of the rest (Data source: Q2 2017 Results): However, competition is building. Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY) has seen its emicizumab (ACE910) drug perform well against its primary and all its secondary endpoints in its Phase III trial. As it explained:

The primary endpoint showed a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in treated bleeds of 87% (risk rate [RR]=0.13, p<0.0001) with emicizumab prophylaxis compared with on-demand (no prophylaxis; episodic use only) bypassing agents.
Although Shire and Roche are taking the battle of the treatments through the court, it is clear that should it reach the market (perhaps next year), it poses a sizeable threat to Feiba’s revenue. Shire’s CEO, Flemming Ornskov, argued that, despite reservations, ACE910 could result in hefty market share losses:

While we don't know for sure how much of our approximately $800 million in annual global sales of FEIBA is at risk, and this will most certainly be impacted by the potential approval timing, the final label and the future clinical and real-world data generated from patients, we do think that the market's current expectation for up to 50% share erosion after five years post-launch is reasonable. That said, we believe there will be no one-size-fits-all approach to treating these kinds of patients, and FEIBA will remain an important therapeutic option also in the future.
Roche is also in the process of releasing data on its Phase III trial pitching emicizumab into the hemophilia without inhibitors treatment. Naturally, should this readout be strong, this poses a threat to a far larger part of hematology revenue. Undoubtedly, as HealthBlogger highlighted:

The unmet need in this segment is much lower than in the inhibitor segment, because the factor VIII replacement therapy (i.e. ADVATE) is a high efficacious therapy for these patients, but if the drug will show a similar compelling profile also in this segment, it’s reasonable to assume that Shire will lose additional market share also in this therapeutic indication.
Roche is thus posing a looming and near-term threat to Shire’s strong position in the hematology market. Other competitors are also lining up to take a share of the spoils, however. BioMarin, for instance, has seen strong results from its Phase I/II trial of its BMN 270 gene therapy. Although it still needs to pass through the larger Phase III trial, some believe that BMN 270 could be on the market by 2019. This would undoubtedly put more pressure on Shire’s hematology revenue. With other pharma companies coming up with potential new drugs to take share from Shire’s already on-market drugs, investors are understandably a bit more aware of the potential frailty in its major revenue generator.

Nonetheless, Shire has not been standing still with its own pipeline in the hematology space. Its lanadelumab (SHP643) Phase III trial for heredity angioedema (NYSE:HAE) is showing early signs of strong promise in its primary and secondary endpoints. Shire may well be facing tougher competition in its core hemophilia market, yet its broader hematology franchise appears to be continuing its strong history of advances.

Lialda Laid Low?

Shire has also been facing a tough environment for its ulcerative colitis drug, LIALDA. The drug had become the star of its internal medicine franchise and contributed nearly 6% of total revenue in Q2 2017:

News that Zydus Cadila had been given approval by the FDA to release a generic of the drug, therefore, was hardly well received by investors. The arrival of the LIALDA generic was, as Shire’s CEO Flemming Ornskov noted, “a little earlier than [they] anticipated.”

As a result, this had driven down the revenue predictions for FY 2017 to between $14.3 billion and $14.6 billion (driven, as it explained, primarily by the generics arrival). Despite this, however, it remains the only generic on the market at present and as such Shire believes it can keep its market share fairly healthy. As Ornskov explained:

in a market with one generic competitor and, for the matter, even if there was a second, we think we can maintain a reasonable share of this market in the next few years.
Clearly, however, it will impact upon margins for the drug. What is more, it is hard to argue with Ornskov when he explained that “longer term, [maintaining market share] will become increasingly difficult.”

Although an unwelcome revenue shock, however, Shire remains well-placed in its internal medicine franchise. GATTEX, its drug for short bowel syndrome, saw its constant-currency revenue growth jump 70% in Q2 2017. With Shire directing its LIALDA sales teams to focus on GATTEX, we can expect to see continued strong growth in this drugs revenue contribution. Indeed, its performance should be strong enough to soften the blow coming from the revenue declines seen in the LIALDA business.

The threats to its hematological and LIALDA revenue are certainly something to watch, yet it is important to note that Shire has a great many opportunities facing it which investors have perhaps forgotten in the face of recent news flow.

Ophthalmology Opportunity

Ophthalmology is a new business area. It opened a unit back in May 2014 seeing an opportunity to do as it has done throughout its history: fill a research vacuum in rare and specialty diseases.

XIIDRA (picked up as part of their $160 million acquisition of SARcode in 2013) received approval in July 2016. It was the first drug to treat both the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. This gives it the edge on the established market drug, RESTASIS, already generated strong revenue for Allergan (AGN). XIIDRA also has another benefit over RESTASIS: it works faster.

Unsurprisingly, therefore, XIIDRA has already shown good revenue momentum. As Jeffrey Poulton, Shire’s CFO, noted:

We continue to be pleased with the performance of XIIDRA since launch. XIIDRA contributed $57 million in sales during the quarter, as prescription demand increased 13% from Q1, with market share increasing to approximately 23% by the end of Q2.
Indeed, it has already built up its market share rapidly since it was launched (Data source: Q1 2017 Results Presentation): Yet, here is the thing, this is a huge market share despite the fact that XIIDRA has not yet gained access to a large part of the DED market. As Poulton added at Q1 2017:

Importantly, this very impressive [market share] gain has been primarily driven by our ability to command share in the commercial insurance market, where XIIDRA has broad coverage. In the commercial market alone, our share is, of course, much higher than 22%. As you may know, we do not have broad Medicare coverage yet. I remain optimistic that we will be able to improve access to the Medicare population, who accounts for more than 40% of the current dry eye disease market.
Adding later that:

We’re building this [XIIDRA] brand into a blockbuster like we did with VYVANSE, step-by-step, keeping in mind we have patents until 2029 and expect few potential competitive entrants before XIIDRA’s patent expiry.
What is more, Shire has good pipeline prospects for building a more broad-based ophthalmology franchise. As well as additional DED developments, it has good trial progress in glaucoma and infectious conjunctivitis (Source: Shire Ophthalmology Pipeline in July 2017):",L,-1.81

I'm like the man from Texas. You see, the man from Missouri always says, 'You've got to show me.' But the man from Texas says, 'You've got to put it in my hand.'"" —Jack London
Novavax (NASDAQ: NVAX) is a clinical-stage biotech company with an enviable pipeline, including a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a disease that afflicts millions of people around the world. Novavax's maternal RSV vaccine candidate is in the Phase III clinical trial stage. Novavax's work toward a viable RSV vaccine won the backing of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2015, including up to $89 million in grants to support the development and clinical trials of a maternal vaccine.

Novavax's story goes well beyond just one vaccine, with other prospective drugs in the pipeline, including vaccines for the Zika virus and Ebola, as well as a novel nanoparticle flu vaccine that utilizes the company's proprietary Matrix-M adjuvant.

This would all seem to add up to an exceptional story. Unfortunately, there is a very serious hitch: In September 2016, the Phase III clinical trial of Novavax's RSV vaccine for elderly patients, dubbed “Resolve”, laid an egg. The trial failed to meet both its primary and secondary endpoints. The market reacted as one would expect, with Novavax's share price taking a more than 83 percent dive overnight. Since then, the stock has slipped further and now trades around $1.00 per share. That is a far cry from the $8.34 per share posted the day the Resolve trial results were announced.",L,-8.0

My last report, published in February, provided a detailed analysis of the company's initial gene therapy product, ABO-102, which is in clinical trials for San Filippo Syndrome Type A. This company uses an identical AAV9 vector to that employed by AveXis (AVXS) for their SMA gene therapy product. Initial data from the first six patients is extremely encouraging demonstrating a dose response in biomarkers (such as urinary GAG and CSF GAG) and suggestive evidence that the patients are experiencing a neurocognitive benefit. In fact, the clinical trial data presented during the past six months on this product really couldn't have been any better. You can read about this product in my initial report and see the initial clinical trial data in the company presentation. Without knowing pricing strategy or the outlook for reimbursement in my last report I suggested that future cash flows from this product alone likely have an NPV of $1.5bn - $3bn, equivalent to $30 - $60/share.",W,-27.39
2017-08-22,CYTK,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/handwriting-on-the-wall-suggests-progress-in-als-may-be-imminent-says-cytokinetics-ceo," 'Writing on the wall' suggests progress in ALS may be imminent, says Cytokinetics CEO","San Franciscan firm Cytokinetics (Nasdaq: CYTK) is pursuing an unusual angle to therapeutic discovery, starting from an understanding of the biology of muscles in order to explore treatment options in different disease areas.

This approach has seen the company develop a diverse pipeline of candidates, in heart failure, in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where lead candidate tirasemtiv is due to read out at Phase III later this year.

Launched 20 years ago, chief executive Robert Blum was with the firm from the start, leading in R&D and ultimately taking the tiller a few years after they went public in 2004.

Commenting on the company’s philosophy, Mr Blum points to: ""A pipeline that builds on one another, in terms of economies in drug discovery and synergies in drug development activities.""

Amgen collaboration in heart failure

As an example, he cites the company’s long-standing collaboration with fellow Californian biotech Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN), which he says has enabled investment in longer shots such as tirasemtiv.

""[Omecamtiv mecarbil] could ultimately be our most valuable program, and that has afforded us some advantages.""

""That's how we can make the commitment, take the risk, on tirasemtiv. Because we have partnered in other programs, most importantly omecamtiv mecarbil, with Amgen.”

“That could ultimately be our most valuable program, and that has afforded us some advantages. This candidate addresses a very large unmet need - high-risk heart failure patients who are recently hospitalized and therefore at high risk of death or readmission.”

“Heart failure is the largest cardiovascular market that is not well served by existing therapies. It's the number one reason why people over the age of 65 are hospitalized and the single largest line item in the pharmacotherapy budget for Medicare.”

Through its collaborations, Cytokinetics has been able to raise primarily non-diutive capital of over $500 million.

The economic potential in one program feeds into the rest of the company’s portfolio.

Mr Blum says: “As the drug went into Phase III it triggered milestone payments that enabled us to co-invest with Amgen to buy up our royalty economics.”

“We then sold a piece of those to generate additional capital, that we could invest in tirasemtiv.”

“I think this is most possible when you can organically build a pipeline by being the leader in one slice of biology. That affords these kinds of opportunities.""

Astellas collaboration in ALS

As well as Amgen, Cytokinetics is partnered with Japan’s Astellas Pharma (TYO: 4503), this time to develop treatments in neuromuscular indications.

While traditional approaches to ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, have sought to combat the condition from the perspective of nerve decay, Cytokinetics is looking at the disease through the prism of muscle biology, “remaining agnostic as to why the nerves may be degenerating.”

Mr Blum says: “We do know that the muscles are ultimately where the action is in the disease. Patients who live with ALS suffer a ruthless decline of muscle function, and typically die within three to four years, of respiratory failure and pneumonia.""

Cytokinetics believes its compound will be able to increase muscle force, empower and delay the time to muscle weakness and fatigue.

Recognizing the high burden of the disease and the high level of unmet need In ALS, Mr Blum says: “We knew that that could provide a very meaningful new opportunity to address the disease in ways unlike any other.""

The deal with Astellas was synergistic, as both companies are operating in the same research space. Mr Blum saw an advantage to combining their programs, as the company is: “making a major commitment to muscle biology, and employing different approaches that we thought to be quite complementary to ours.""

Cytokinetics has sold to Astellas an option on tirasemtiv, which would provide rights to co-develop and co-commercialize the drug outside of North America and Europe, where the American firm retains exclusivity.

Mr Blum says data from a large Phase III trial into the candidate will be presented at the annual International Symposium on ALS/MND, in Boston, in December.

“This is designed to confirm and extend findings from our earlier studies.”

""If the data are positive, we as a company are ready for regulatory filings in the US and Europe by mid-2018 to support our commercial activities. We're intending to commercialize this drug candidate ourselves in North America and Europe.""

Positive regulatory environment for ALS

Of particular interest in this therapeutic area is the recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of Radicava (edaravone), the first new drug in ALS for over two decades.

""The handwriting on the wall suggests that the division of neurology is accelerating review and approval of certain drugs for high unmet need.”

Unusually, the positive decision was the result of the FDA calling on the drugmaker, Japan’s Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma (TYO: 4508), to file for marketing authorization.

Asked whether this suggests a more positive approach toward expediting therapies, including for ALS, Mr Blum says: ""Yes, I think it probably does. The handwriting on the wall suggests that the division of neurology is accelerating review and approval of certain drugs for high unmet need.”

""What was noteworthy about the approval was that the trials seemed to be conflicting in terms of efficacy. I think the FDA was compelled by the fact that the drug appears to be safe, and they approved the drug subject to post-marketing conditions.""

""It's an important advance for the field, to be sure, but I think it will be interesting to see how it will be commercialized, and what the uptake will be.""

Under the stewardship of new FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, the FDA appears to be taking a more proactive approach, including hiring more staff, to bring innovative therapies to patients expeditiously.

Asked about progress at the FDA, Mr Blum says: ""From what I can see, things are moving forward very constructively. I think there's an opportunity for patients, caregivers, regulatory authorities, industry sponsors and everybody to align more on innovation, and create opportunities for new medicines that are truly innovative, to move forward swiftly.""
""I think the changes at the FDA underscore their commitment to the original intent of biopharmaceutical innovation, and that's the most encouraging sign coming out of Washington.""",L,-4.42

2017-08-21,BMY,https://www.mesotheliomahelp.org/2017/08/results-opdivo-trial-may-help-mesothelioma-oncologists-identify-patients-will-benefit-drug/,,"In April, MesotheliomaHelp reported on the findings of a phase I clinical trial showing that the five-year survival rate for some lung cancer patients treated with Opdivo (nivolumab), an immunotherapy treatment, was “much higher” than historical data. Now, researchers report that results from a phase III clinical trial may help oncologists determine those lung cancer patients, and possibly, mesothelioma patients, who will benefit from the immuno-oncology drug.

Opdivo, developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, works by blocking the PD-L1 protein and activating the immune system, leading it to attack and kill cancer cells. According to a June 21 press release from The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, a team of researchers led by David Carbone, MD, PhD, of The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer – Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute, found that although the trial did not improve progression-free survival when compared with chemotherapy in the overall population, those patients with a high expression of PD-L1 did benefit.

“The good news is that we discovered that a subset of patients who had both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status did experience a significant benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

Specifically, the researchers report that patients who had “both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status” realized a 75 percent response rate compared to just 16 percent response rate with low mutation burden and low PDL-1. However, the response rates for chemotherapy treatment in these same subsets were nearly the same leading the researchers to conclude that the PDL-1 markers “were selective for immunotherapy.”

Mesothelioma, a rare, asbestos-related cancer of the lining of the lungs, abdomen or heart, is highly aggressive and is resistant to many cancer treatments. The prognosis for mesothelioma patients is usually grim: the average survival time varies from 4 – 18 months after diagnosis. For the close to 3,000 Americans diagnosed with the disease each year, personalized care may bring a breakthrough treatment not previously considered by their physician.

The benefits of personalized care for mesothelioma patients have been proven where researchers have identified genetic biomarkers that reflect the aggressiveness of mesothelioma as well as markers that can assess the effectiveness of a particular treatment.

Opdivo is currently in a phase III clinical trial in the UK for mesothelioma patients. Known as The CheckpOiNt Blockade For Inhibition of Relapsed Mesothelioma, or CONIFRM, the trial has a goal of ‘exploiting the potential of immunotherapy.’

Keytruda, which gained popularity after saving former President Jimmy Carter’s life after sending his melanoma into remission, is also a PD-L1 inhibitor. Both immunotherapy drugs have shown in studies to be effective in fighting pleural mesothelioma. Keytruda is, perhaps, more well known due to eight-year mesothelioma survivor Mavis Nye of England, who went into remission after a two-year clinical trial of the drug.

“This study is an important step toward understanding the impact of tumor mutation burden and PDL-1 in immunotherapy response. This data shows we should evaluate these two factors independently to most accurately define who will benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

About Recro Pharma, Inc.

Recro is a specialty pharmaceutical company that operates through two business divisions, an Acute Care, hospital product division and a revenue-generating contract development and manufacturing, or CDMO division, located at the Company's Gainesville facility. The Acute Care division is primarily focused on developing innovative products for hospital and other acute care settings. The Company's lead product candidate is a proprietary injectable form of meloxicam, a long-acting preferential COX-2 inhibitor. IV meloxicam 30mg has successfully completed two pivotal Phase III clinical efficacy trials in patients following bunionectomy and abdominoplasty surgeries, a large double blind Phase III safety trial, four Phase II clinical trials for the management of moderate to severe post-operative pain, as well as other safety studies. As injectable meloxicam is in the non-opioid class of drugs, the Company believes it will overcome many of the issues associated with commonly prescribed opioid therapeutics, including respiratory depression, constipation, excessive nausea and vomiting, as well as having no addictive potential while maintaining meaningful analgesic effects for relief of pain. The Company's CDMO division leverages its formulation expertise to develop and manufacture pharmaceutical products using its proprietary delivery technologies and other manufacturing services for commercial partners who commercialize or plan to commercialize these products. These collaborations can result in revenue streams including royalties, profit sharing, research and development and manufacturing fees, which support continued operations for its CDMO division and it contributes non-dilutive funding for the development and pre-commercialization activities of its Acute Care division.

2017-08-21,IRWD,https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Ironwood+Pharma+%28IRWD%29+Announces+FDA+Approval+of+DUZALLO+for+Treatment+of+Hyperuricemia+in+Patients+with+Uncontrolled+Gout/13222622.html,,"Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IRWD) today announced DUZALLO was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a once-daily oral treatment for hyperuricemia associated with gout in patients who have not achieved target serum uric acid (sUA) levels with a medically appropriate daily dose of allopurinol alone. DUZALLO is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Ironwood expects DUZALLO to be commercially available early in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Gout is a highly symptomatic and painful form of inflammatory arthritis caused by hyperuricemia, or elevated sUA levels in the blood, which can lead to painful flares and serious potential long-term health consequences.DUZALLO is the first drug that combines the current standard of care for the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout, allopurinol, with the most recent FDA-approved treatment for this condition, lesinurad. This fixed-dose combination provides a dual mechanism of action in a single tablet that can address both underlying causes of hyperuricemia – overproduction and underexcretion of serum uric acid.

“The approval of DUZALLO provides a new fixed-dose and dual-mechanism treatment option to help patients with uncontrolled gout achieve target serum uric acid levels. This represents an important and needed new option in the treatment of hyperuricemia,” said Michael A. Becker, M.D., professor emeritus of medicine, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL. “Gout is a serious and potentially progressive and debilitating inflammatory disease. Getting patients with gout to serum urate goal, and keeping them at or below goal, are essential to success in treating these patients. DUZALLO will help reduce the significant unmet need among patients in the U.S. who fail to get their serum uric acid levels to goal despite taking allopurinol alone.”

“With DUZALLO, nearly twice as many patients with uncontrolled gout may be able to achieve target serum uric acid levels compared to those patients taking allopurinol alone, which is important, considering the significant unmet need among uncontrolled gout patients to get to goal of under 6 mg/dL,” said Tom McCourt, senior vice president of marketing and sales and chief commercial officer at Ironwood. “We believe DUZALLO will be the critical driver behind Ironwood’s gout franchise, which is expected to exceed total annual U.S. peak sales of $300 million.”",L,-2.65
2017-08-21,NVO,https://www.gurufocus.com/news/556495/3-companies-aiming-to-significantly-reduce-diabetes-treatment-costs,,"Total U.S. health care spending in 2015 was an astronomical $3.2 trillion. That is 16% of the entire national debt. As much as we blame the prices of new drugs for this gargantuan sum, one of the biggest chunks of it comes from diabetes, a disease whose treatment has not changed all that much since 1922. According to the American Diabetes Association, diabetes accounts for $322 billion in total U.S. health care spending as of 2016.

One Harvard study puts the annual cost at a much higher $822 billion annually. Whichever number you want to believe, it is among the costliest diseases in the world, for both patients and taxpayers. Thanks to Medicare and Medicaid, diabetes costs are socialized.



There are two reasons for the rising costs. First, the price of insulin has tripled since 2002. Second, the nature of lifetime treatment necessitates ever-rising doses of insulin as the disease progresses.

Short of hoping Americans radically change their diets overnight and drastically reduce sugar intake, the problem is not going away. But there is hope for significant cost reduction nonetheless. Here are three companies on the cutting edge of the newest diabetes advancements that, with some luck, may help reduce this nearly unfathomable cost to the U.S. economy and taxpayers.

Novo Nordisk and semaglutide

Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) recently announced its once-weekly GLP-1 agonist semaglutide handily beat Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide in terms of weight loss and blood sugar control in a pivotal Phase III trial. GLP-1 agonists, unlike insulin, stimulate pancreatic cells to produce insulin in a glucose-dependent manner. Meaning, GLP-1 agonists only induce native insulin production when blood glucose levels are high enough to trigger it. This is much more convenient than manually measuring blood sugar before injecting insulin directly.

While markets are focused on the one-on-one beat, raising Novo shares at the expense of Eli Lilly’s, there is potentially more exciting news regarding semaglutide yet to come. Novo Nordisk has already demonstrated in a Phase II trial that an oral formulation of semaglutide can work as well. If this continues into Phase III, the implication could be big for diabetes treatment costs. Oral formulations of otherwise intravenous drugs increase patient compliance and, if it works better than GLP-1 agonists currently on the market, it could keep diabetes patients healthier for longer, reducing long-run costs as the disease progresses, by far the costliest aspect of diabetes.

Roche and the artificial pancreas

Another innovative way to increase patient compliance and reduce long-run costs is to simply automate everything. Roche Holding AG (RHHBY) is currently sponsoring a late-stage development of an artificial pancreas that uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology together with an insulin pump to keep diabetics’ blood sugar in perpetual balance.

A pivotal Phase III trial was announced late last month, cosponsored by Roche Diabetics Care Inc. The ingenious closed-loop system uses a smartphone app to notify patients when blood sugar levels go out of range of preset limits. Since most of the damage from diabetes occurs when patients are out of their blood sugar target ranges, by keeping diabetics range-bound for longer, and hopefully perpetually, much of the cumulative damage from diabetes can hopefully be blunted or maybe even prevented for the long run. This closed-loop artificial pancreas is currently intended for Type 1 diabetics, though if successful it may be trialed for the much more prevalent Type 2 population.

Oramed and oral insulin

Perhaps the most ambitious of new diabetes treatments is an oral insulin formulation from Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ORMP). Oramed just recently announced a planned Phase III trial for what has been termed the holy grail of diabetes treatments.

Oral insulin could fundamentally change the entire diabetes playing field since it would change the way insulin interacts with blood glucose and make the process more akin to what occurs in healthy people. Oramed is using similar technology to what Novo Nordisk is using in its own oral GLP-1 treatment, so there is reason to believe it could actually work.

Oral insulin could get prediabetics on insulin earlier since injecting insulin daily is not only inconvenient but almost taboo and a last resort. Getting prediabetics on insulin faster could go a long way in reducing late-stage complications as the disease progresses and insulin resistance sets in.

There is reason to believe insulin resistance – the factor that necessitates ever-higher doses of insulin and where most of the costs lay - will be less of a problem with an oral formulation because oral insulin goes through the liver, which is the natural organ for regulating insulin release once it receives it from the pancreas. It is a way of having the body naturally regulate insulin release rather than having to measure the dose via blood sugar analysis constantly.

All or any success amongst these three companies could take a significant bite out of overall diabetes costs over the next decade and beyond. Diabetes is by far the costliest health care niche and badly in need of a major advance. With three companies with potentially paradigm-shifting treatments in the pipe, chances are we will see that major advance before the close of this decade and before diabetes costs spiral completely out of control, if they have not done so already.",L,-1.03

2017-08-22,SHPG,,"Shire: At 52-Week Low, Long-Term Opportunity Appears Significant","Shire's share price has been languishing near 52-week lows for a little while now.

Despite valid concerns about the prospect of intense competition in its important hematology franchise, the business remains attractive.

New assets in ophthalmology and oncology are generating strong results already, and additional assets look set to continue the trend.

Baxalta deal is also going well, and the potential exit from neuroscience should consolidate its reputation as the rare disease specialist at a time when orphan drug growth is expected to grow rapidly.

Combined with a highly cash-generative and healthy business, Shire looks very attractive for long-term investors right now. Shire’s* (SHPG) share price recently hit a 52-week low in both its London- and NASDAQ-listed shares. Yet, I continue to struggle to precisely see why this should be the case. Its H1 2017 results showed a company which was doing well across its franchises except neuroscience in which continued destocking in the second quarter of the year pushed it into negative growth (Data source: Q2 2017 Results):  Yet, nothing immediately jumped out as being justification for continued weakness in its share price. After all, excluding the effects of destocking, even neuroscience had seen growth.

As we will see, however, Shire is certainly facing intense competition in some of its core areas. Yet, its success in fresh R&D results, combined with current and potential corporate level changes, suggests Shire is being undervalued right now. For long-term investors, today's somewhat subdued share price seems an ideal opportunity to buy into an increasingly compelling growth story coming from the world’s global leader in rare diseases.

A Hematology Hiatus Coming?

First off, we need to reflect a little on one of the main drivers of Shire’s share price weakness. Chiefly, this has surrounded increasing potential competition in some of its core franchises. This is especially true in its hematology franchise. Picked up as part of its Baxalta acquisition in 2016, it is now the largest revenue generator in the company. Yet, investors are getting a little nervous about potential threats in this area.

The subject has been more thoroughly explored by HealthBlogger last month. Shire has, however, a leading market position in the hematology market. Its ADVATE and ADYNOVATE are approved for use in the treatment of hemophilia without inhibitor (that is, for those patients who have not developed Factor VIII inhibitors). Indeed, ADVATE is the top Factor VIII brand with proven efficacy in the market. Similarly, for those who have developed Factor VIII inhibitors, Shire markets FEIBA which is an anti-inhibitor coagulant or bypassing agent. For Shire, this latter area contributes about 23% of total hematology revenue with the former contributing the lion’s share of the rest (Data source: Q2 2017 Results): However, competition is building. Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY) has seen its emicizumab (ACE910) drug perform well against its primary and all its secondary endpoints in its Phase III trial. As it explained:

The primary endpoint showed a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in treated bleeds of 87% (risk rate [RR]=0.13, p<0.0001) with emicizumab prophylaxis compared with on-demand (no prophylaxis; episodic use only) bypassing agents.
Although Shire and Roche are taking the battle of the treatments through the court, it is clear that should it reach the market (perhaps next year), it poses a sizeable threat to Feiba’s revenue. Shire’s CEO, Flemming Ornskov, argued that, despite reservations, ACE910 could result in hefty market share losses:

While we don't know for sure how much of our approximately $800 million in annual global sales of FEIBA is at risk, and this will most certainly be impacted by the potential approval timing, the final label and the future clinical and real-world data generated from patients, we do think that the market's current expectation for up to 50% share erosion after five years post-launch is reasonable. That said, we believe there will be no one-size-fits-all approach to treating these kinds of patients, and FEIBA will remain an important therapeutic option also in the future.
Roche is also in the process of releasing data on its Phase III trial pitching emicizumab into the hemophilia without inhibitors treatment. Naturally, should this readout be strong, this poses a threat to a far larger part of hematology revenue. Undoubtedly, as HealthBlogger highlighted:

The unmet need in this segment is much lower than in the inhibitor segment, because the factor VIII replacement therapy (i.e. ADVATE) is a high efficacious therapy for these patients, but if the drug will show a similar compelling profile also in this segment, it’s reasonable to assume that Shire will lose additional market share also in this therapeutic indication.
Roche is thus posing a looming and near-term threat to Shire’s strong position in the hematology market. Other competitors are also lining up to take a share of the spoils, however. BioMarin, for instance, has seen strong results from its Phase I/II trial of its BMN 270 gene therapy. Although it still needs to pass through the larger Phase III trial, some believe that BMN 270 could be on the market by 2019. This would undoubtedly put more pressure on Shire’s hematology revenue. With other pharma companies coming up with potential new drugs to take share from Shire’s already on-market drugs, investors are understandably a bit more aware of the potential frailty in its major revenue generator.

Nonetheless, Shire has not been standing still with its own pipeline in the hematology space. Its lanadelumab (SHP643) Phase III trial for heredity angioedema (NYSE:HAE) is showing early signs of strong promise in its primary and secondary endpoints. Shire may well be facing tougher competition in its core hemophilia market, yet its broader hematology franchise appears to be continuing its strong history of advances.

Lialda Laid Low?

Shire has also been facing a tough environment for its ulcerative colitis drug, LIALDA. The drug had become the star of its internal medicine franchise and contributed nearly 6% of total revenue in Q2 2017:

News that Zydus Cadila had been given approval by the FDA to release a generic of the drug, therefore, was hardly well received by investors. The arrival of the LIALDA generic was, as Shire’s CEO Flemming Ornskov noted, “a little earlier than [they] anticipated.”

As a result, this had driven down the revenue predictions for FY 2017 to between $14.3 billion and $14.6 billion (driven, as it explained, primarily by the generics arrival). Despite this, however, it remains the only generic on the market at present and as such Shire believes it can keep its market share fairly healthy. As Ornskov explained:

in a market with one generic competitor and, for the matter, even if there was a second, we think we can maintain a reasonable share of this market in the next few years.
Clearly, however, it will impact upon margins for the drug. What is more, it is hard to argue with Ornskov when he explained that “longer term, [maintaining market share] will become increasingly difficult.”

Although an unwelcome revenue shock, however, Shire remains well-placed in its internal medicine franchise. GATTEX, its drug for short bowel syndrome, saw its constant-currency revenue growth jump 70% in Q2 2017. With Shire directing its LIALDA sales teams to focus on GATTEX, we can expect to see continued strong growth in this drugs revenue contribution. Indeed, its performance should be strong enough to soften the blow coming from the revenue declines seen in the LIALDA business.

The threats to its hematological and LIALDA revenue are certainly something to watch, yet it is important to note that Shire has a great many opportunities facing it which investors have perhaps forgotten in the face of recent news flow.

Ophthalmology Opportunity

Ophthalmology is a new business area. It opened a unit back in May 2014 seeing an opportunity to do as it has done throughout its history: fill a research vacuum in rare and specialty diseases.

XIIDRA (picked up as part of their $160 million acquisition of SARcode in 2013) received approval in July 2016. It was the first drug to treat both the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. This gives it the edge on the established market drug, RESTASIS, already generated strong revenue for Allergan (AGN). XIIDRA also has another benefit over RESTASIS: it works faster.

Unsurprisingly, therefore, XIIDRA has already shown good revenue momentum. As Jeffrey Poulton, Shire’s CFO, noted:

We continue to be pleased with the performance of XIIDRA since launch. XIIDRA contributed $57 million in sales during the quarter, as prescription demand increased 13% from Q1, with market share increasing to approximately 23% by the end of Q2.
Indeed, it has already built up its market share rapidly since it was launched (Data source: Q1 2017 Results Presentation): Yet, here is the thing, this is a huge market share despite the fact that XIIDRA has not yet gained access to a large part of the DED market. As Poulton added at Q1 2017:

Importantly, this very impressive [market share] gain has been primarily driven by our ability to command share in the commercial insurance market, where XIIDRA has broad coverage. In the commercial market alone, our share is, of course, much higher than 22%. As you may know, we do not have broad Medicare coverage yet. I remain optimistic that we will be able to improve access to the Medicare population, who accounts for more than 40% of the current dry eye disease market.
Adding later that:

We’re building this [XIIDRA] brand into a blockbuster like we did with VYVANSE, step-by-step, keeping in mind we have patents until 2029 and expect few potential competitive entrants before XIIDRA’s patent expiry.
What is more, Shire has good pipeline prospects for building a more broad-based ophthalmology franchise. As well as additional DED developments, it has good trial progress in glaucoma and infectious conjunctivitis (Source: Shire Ophthalmology Pipeline in July 2017):",L,-1.81

I'm like the man from Texas. You see, the man from Missouri always says, 'You've got to show me.' But the man from Texas says, 'You've got to put it in my hand.'"" —Jack London
Novavax (NASDAQ: NVAX) is a clinical-stage biotech company with an enviable pipeline, including a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a disease that afflicts millions of people around the world. Novavax's maternal RSV vaccine candidate is in the Phase III clinical trial stage. Novavax's work toward a viable RSV vaccine won the backing of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2015, including up to $89 million in grants to support the development and clinical trials of a maternal vaccine.

Novavax's story goes well beyond just one vaccine, with other prospective drugs in the pipeline, including vaccines for the Zika virus and Ebola, as well as a novel nanoparticle flu vaccine that utilizes the company's proprietary Matrix-M adjuvant.

This would all seem to add up to an exceptional story. Unfortunately, there is a very serious hitch: In September 2016, the Phase III clinical trial of Novavax's RSV vaccine for elderly patients, dubbed “Resolve”, laid an egg. The trial failed to meet both its primary and secondary endpoints. The market reacted as one would expect, with Novavax's share price taking a more than 83 percent dive overnight. Since then, the stock has slipped further and now trades around $1.00 per share. That is a far cry from the $8.34 per share posted the day the Resolve trial results were announced.",L,-8.0

This approach has seen the company develop a diverse pipeline of candidates, in heart failure, in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where lead candidate tirasemtiv is due to read out at Phase III later this year.

Launched 20 years ago, chief executive Robert Blum was with the firm from the start, leading in R&D and ultimately taking the tiller a few years after they went public in 2004.

Commenting on the company’s philosophy, Mr Blum points to: ""A pipeline that builds on one another, in terms of economies in drug discovery and synergies in drug development activities.""

Amgen collaboration in heart failure

As an example, he cites the company’s long-standing collaboration with fellow Californian biotech Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN), which he says has enabled investment in longer shots such as tirasemtiv.

""[Omecamtiv mecarbil] could ultimately be our most valuable program, and that has afforded us some advantages.""

""That's how we can make the commitment, take the risk, on tirasemtiv. Because we have partnered in other programs, most importantly omecamtiv mecarbil, with Amgen.”

“That could ultimately be our most valuable program, and that has afforded us some advantages. This candidate addresses a very large unmet need - high-risk heart failure patients who are recently hospitalized and therefore at high risk of death or readmission.”

“Heart failure is the largest cardiovascular market that is not well served by existing therapies. It's the number one reason why people over the age of 65 are hospitalized and the single largest line item in the pharmacotherapy budget for Medicare.”

Through its collaborations, Cytokinetics has been able to raise primarily non-diutive capital of over $500 million.

The economic potential in one program feeds into the rest of the company’s portfolio.

Mr Blum says: “As the drug went into Phase III it triggered milestone payments that enabled us to co-invest with Amgen to buy up our royalty economics.”

“We then sold a piece of those to generate additional capital, that we could invest in tirasemtiv.”

“I think this is most possible when you can organically build a pipeline by being the leader in one slice of biology. That affords these kinds of opportunities.""

Astellas collaboration in ALS

As well as Amgen, Cytokinetics is partnered with Japan’s Astellas Pharma (TYO: 4503), this time to develop treatments in neuromuscular indications.

While traditional approaches to ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, have sought to combat the condition from the perspective of nerve decay, Cytokinetics is looking at the disease through the prism of muscle biology, “remaining agnostic as to why the nerves may be degenerating.”

Mr Blum says: “We do know that the muscles are ultimately where the action is in the disease. Patients who live with ALS suffer a ruthless decline of muscle function, and typically die within three to four years, of respiratory failure and pneumonia.""

Cytokinetics believes its compound will be able to increase muscle force, empower and delay the time to muscle weakness and fatigue.

Recognizing the high burden of the disease and the high level of unmet need In ALS, Mr Blum says: “We knew that that could provide a very meaningful new opportunity to address the disease in ways unlike any other.""

The deal with Astellas was synergistic, as both companies are operating in the same research space. Mr Blum saw an advantage to combining their programs, as the company is: “making a major commitment to muscle biology, and employing different approaches that we thought to be quite complementary to ours.""

Cytokinetics has sold to Astellas an option on tirasemtiv, which would provide rights to co-develop and co-commercialize the drug outside of North America and Europe, where the American firm retains exclusivity.

Mr Blum says data from a large Phase III trial into the candidate will be presented at the annual International Symposium on ALS/MND, in Boston, in December.

“This is designed to confirm and extend findings from our earlier studies.”

""If the data are positive, we as a company are ready for regulatory filings in the US and Europe by mid-2018 to support our commercial activities. We're intending to commercialize this drug candidate ourselves in North America and Europe.""

Positive regulatory environment for ALS

Of particular interest in this therapeutic area is the recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of Radicava (edaravone), the first new drug in ALS for over two decades.

""The handwriting on the wall suggests that the division of neurology is accelerating review and approval of certain drugs for high unmet need.”

Unusually, the positive decision was the result of the FDA calling on the drugmaker, Japan’s Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma (TYO: 4508), to file for marketing authorization.

Asked whether this suggests a more positive approach toward expediting therapies, including for ALS, Mr Blum says: ""Yes, I think it probably does. The handwriting on the wall suggests that the division of neurology is accelerating review and approval of certain drugs for high unmet need.”

""What was noteworthy about the approval was that the trials seemed to be conflicting in terms of efficacy. I think the FDA was compelled by the fact that the drug appears to be safe, and they approved the drug subject to post-marketing conditions.""

""It's an important advance for the field, to be sure, but I think it will be interesting to see how it will be commercialized, and what the uptake will be.""

Under the stewardship of new FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, the FDA appears to be taking a more proactive approach, including hiring more staff, to bring innovative therapies to patients expeditiously.

Asked about progress at the FDA, Mr Blum says: ""From what I can see, things are moving forward very constructively. I think there's an opportunity for patients, caregivers, regulatory authorities, industry sponsors and everybody to align more on innovation, and create opportunities for new medicines that are truly innovative, to move forward swiftly.""
""I think the changes at the FDA underscore their commitment to the original intent of biopharmaceutical innovation, and that's the most encouraging sign coming out of Washington.""",L,-4.42

2017-08-21,BMY,https://www.mesotheliomahelp.org/2017/08/results-opdivo-trial-may-help-mesothelioma-oncologists-identify-patients-will-benefit-drug/,,"In April, MesotheliomaHelp reported on the findings of a phase I clinical trial showing that the five-year survival rate for some lung cancer patients treated with Opdivo (nivolumab), an immunotherapy treatment, was “much higher” than historical data. Now, researchers report that results from a phase III clinical trial may help oncologists determine those lung cancer patients, and possibly, mesothelioma patients, who will benefit from the immuno-oncology drug.

Opdivo, developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, works by blocking the PD-L1 protein and activating the immune system, leading it to attack and kill cancer cells. According to a June 21 press release from The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, a team of researchers led by David Carbone, MD, PhD, of The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer – Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute, found that although the trial did not improve progression-free survival when compared with chemotherapy in the overall population, those patients with a high expression of PD-L1 did benefit.

“The good news is that we discovered that a subset of patients who had both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status did experience a significant benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

Specifically, the researchers report that patients who had “both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status” realized a 75 percent response rate compared to just 16 percent response rate with low mutation burden and low PDL-1. However, the response rates for chemotherapy treatment in these same subsets were nearly the same leading the researchers to conclude that the PDL-1 markers “were selective for immunotherapy.”

Mesothelioma, a rare, asbestos-related cancer of the lining of the lungs, abdomen or heart, is highly aggressive and is resistant to many cancer treatments. The prognosis for mesothelioma patients is usually grim: the average survival time varies from 4 – 18 months after diagnosis. For the close to 3,000 Americans diagnosed with the disease each year, personalized care may bring a breakthrough treatment not previously considered by their physician.

The benefits of personalized care for mesothelioma patients have been proven where researchers have identified genetic biomarkers that reflect the aggressiveness of mesothelioma as well as markers that can assess the effectiveness of a particular treatment.

Opdivo is currently in a phase III clinical trial in the UK for mesothelioma patients. Known as The CheckpOiNt Blockade For Inhibition of Relapsed Mesothelioma, or CONIFRM, the trial has a goal of ‘exploiting the potential of immunotherapy.’

Keytruda, which gained popularity after saving former President Jimmy Carter’s life after sending his melanoma into remission, is also a PD-L1 inhibitor. Both immunotherapy drugs have shown in studies to be effective in fighting pleural mesothelioma. Keytruda is, perhaps, more well known due to eight-year mesothelioma survivor Mavis Nye of England, who went into remission after a two-year clinical trial of the drug.

“This study is an important step toward understanding the impact of tumor mutation burden and PDL-1 in immunotherapy response. This data shows we should evaluate these two factors independently to most accurately define who will benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

About Recro Pharma, Inc.

Recro is a specialty pharmaceutical company that operates through two business divisions, an Acute Care, hospital product division and a revenue-generating contract development and manufacturing, or CDMO division, located at the Company's Gainesville facility. The Acute Care division is primarily focused on developing innovative products for hospital and other acute care settings. The Company's lead product candidate is a proprietary injectable form of meloxicam, a long-acting preferential COX-2 inhibitor. IV meloxicam 30mg has successfully completed two pivotal Phase III clinical efficacy trials in patients following bunionectomy and abdominoplasty surgeries, a large double blind Phase III safety trial, four Phase II clinical trials for the management of moderate to severe post-operative pain, as well as other safety studies. As injectable meloxicam is in the non-opioid class of drugs, the Company believes it will overcome many of the issues associated with commonly prescribed opioid therapeutics, including respiratory depression, constipation, excessive nausea and vomiting, as well as having no addictive potential while maintaining meaningful analgesic effects for relief of pain. The Company's CDMO division leverages its formulation expertise to develop and manufacture pharmaceutical products using its proprietary delivery technologies and other manufacturing services for commercial partners who commercialize or plan to commercialize these products. These collaborations can result in revenue streams including royalties, profit sharing, research and development and manufacturing fees, which support continued operations for its CDMO division and it contributes non-dilutive funding for the development and pre-commercialization activities of its Acute Care division.

2017-08-21,IRWD,https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Ironwood+Pharma+%28IRWD%29+Announces+FDA+Approval+of+DUZALLO+for+Treatment+of+Hyperuricemia+in+Patients+with+Uncontrolled+Gout/13222622.html,,"Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IRWD) today announced DUZALLO was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a once-daily oral treatment for hyperuricemia associated with gout in patients who have not achieved target serum uric acid (sUA) levels with a medically appropriate daily dose of allopurinol alone. DUZALLO is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Ironwood expects DUZALLO to be commercially available early in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Gout is a highly symptomatic and painful form of inflammatory arthritis caused by hyperuricemia, or elevated sUA levels in the blood, which can lead to painful flares and serious potential long-term health consequences.DUZALLO is the first drug that combines the current standard of care for the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout, allopurinol, with the most recent FDA-approved treatment for this condition, lesinurad. This fixed-dose combination provides a dual mechanism of action in a single tablet that can address both underlying causes of hyperuricemia – overproduction and underexcretion of serum uric acid.

“The approval of DUZALLO provides a new fixed-dose and dual-mechanism treatment option to help patients with uncontrolled gout achieve target serum uric acid levels. This represents an important and needed new option in the treatment of hyperuricemia,” said Michael A. Becker, M.D., professor emeritus of medicine, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL. “Gout is a serious and potentially progressive and debilitating inflammatory disease. Getting patients with gout to serum urate goal, and keeping them at or below goal, are essential to success in treating these patients. DUZALLO will help reduce the significant unmet need among patients in the U.S. who fail to get their serum uric acid levels to goal despite taking allopurinol alone.”

“With DUZALLO, nearly twice as many patients with uncontrolled gout may be able to achieve target serum uric acid levels compared to those patients taking allopurinol alone, which is important, considering the significant unmet need among uncontrolled gout patients to get to goal of under 6 mg/dL,” said Tom McCourt, senior vice president of marketing and sales and chief commercial officer at Ironwood. “We believe DUZALLO will be the critical driver behind Ironwood’s gout franchise, which is expected to exceed total annual U.S. peak sales of $300 million.”",L,2.65
2017-08-21,NVO,https://www.gurufocus.com/news/556495/3-companies-aiming-to-significantly-reduce-diabetes-treatment-costs,,"Total U.S. health care spending in 2015 was an astronomical $3.2 trillion. That is 16% of the entire national debt. As much as we blame the prices of new drugs for this gargantuan sum, one of the biggest chunks of it comes from diabetes, a disease whose treatment has not changed all that much since 1922. According to the American Diabetes Association, diabetes accounts for $322 billion in total U.S. health care spending as of 2016.

One Harvard study puts the annual cost at a much higher $822 billion annually. Whichever number you want to believe, it is among the costliest diseases in the world, for both patients and taxpayers. Thanks to Medicare and Medicaid, diabetes costs are socialized.



There are two reasons for the rising costs. First, the price of insulin has tripled since 2002. Second, the nature of lifetime treatment necessitates ever-rising doses of insulin as the disease progresses.

Short of hoping Americans radically change their diets overnight and drastically reduce sugar intake, the problem is not going away. But there is hope for significant cost reduction nonetheless. Here are three companies on the cutting edge of the newest diabetes advancements that, with some luck, may help reduce this nearly unfathomable cost to the U.S. economy and taxpayers.

Novo Nordisk and semaglutide

Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) recently announced its once-weekly GLP-1 agonist semaglutide handily beat Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide in terms of weight loss and blood sugar control in a pivotal Phase III trial. GLP-1 agonists, unlike insulin, stimulate pancreatic cells to produce insulin in a glucose-dependent manner. Meaning, GLP-1 agonists only induce native insulin production when blood glucose levels are high enough to trigger it. This is much more convenient than manually measuring blood sugar before injecting insulin directly.

While markets are focused on the one-on-one beat, raising Novo shares at the expense of Eli Lilly’s, there is potentially more exciting news regarding semaglutide yet to come. Novo Nordisk has already demonstrated in a Phase II trial that an oral formulation of semaglutide can work as well. If this continues into Phase III, the implication could be big for diabetes treatment costs. Oral formulations of otherwise intravenous drugs increase patient compliance and, if it works better than GLP-1 agonists currently on the market, it could keep diabetes patients healthier for longer, reducing long-run costs as the disease progresses, by far the costliest aspect of diabetes.

Roche and the artificial pancreas

Another innovative way to increase patient compliance and reduce long-run costs is to simply automate everything. Roche Holding AG (RHHBY) is currently sponsoring a late-stage development of an artificial pancreas that uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology together with an insulin pump to keep diabetics’ blood sugar in perpetual balance.

A pivotal Phase III trial was announced late last month, cosponsored by Roche Diabetics Care Inc. The ingenious closed-loop system uses a smartphone app to notify patients when blood sugar levels go out of range of preset limits. Since most of the damage from diabetes occurs when patients are out of their blood sugar target ranges, by keeping diabetics range-bound for longer, and hopefully perpetually, much of the cumulative damage from diabetes can hopefully be blunted or maybe even prevented for the long run. This closed-loop artificial pancreas is currently intended for Type 1 diabetics, though if successful it may be trialed for the much more prevalent Type 2 population.

Oramed and oral insulin

Perhaps the most ambitious of new diabetes treatments is an oral insulin formulation from Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ORMP). Oramed just recently announced a planned Phase III trial for what has been termed the holy grail of diabetes treatments.

Oral insulin could fundamentally change the entire diabetes playing field since it would change the way insulin interacts with blood glucose and make the process more akin to what occurs in healthy people. Oramed is using similar technology to what Novo Nordisk is using in its own oral GLP-1 treatment, so there is reason to believe it could actually work.

Oral insulin could get prediabetics on insulin earlier since injecting insulin daily is not only inconvenient but almost taboo and a last resort. Getting prediabetics on insulin faster could go a long way in reducing late-stage complications as the disease progresses and insulin resistance sets in.

There is reason to believe insulin resistance – the factor that necessitates ever-higher doses of insulin and where most of the costs lay - will be less of a problem with an oral formulation because oral insulin goes through the liver, which is the natural organ for regulating insulin release once it receives it from the pancreas. It is a way of having the body naturally regulate insulin release rather than having to measure the dose via blood sugar analysis constantly.

All or any success amongst these three companies could take a significant bite out of overall diabetes costs over the next decade and beyond. Diabetes is by far the costliest health care niche and badly in need of a major advance. With three companies with potentially paradigm-shifting treatments in the pipe, chances are we will see that major advance before the close of this decade and before diabetes costs spiral completely out of control, if they have not done so already.",L,1.03

2017-08-22,SHPG,,"Shire: At 52-Week Low, Long-Term Opportunity Appears Significant","Shire's share price has been languishing near 52-week lows for a little while now.

Despite valid concerns about the prospect of intense competition in its important hematology franchise, the business remains attractive.

New assets in ophthalmology and oncology are generating strong results already, and additional assets look set to continue the trend.

Baxalta deal is also going well, and the potential exit from neuroscience should consolidate its reputation as the rare disease specialist at a time when orphan drug growth is expected to grow rapidly.

Combined with a highly cash-generative and healthy business, Shire looks very attractive for long-term investors right now. Shire’s* (SHPG) share price recently hit a 52-week low in both its London- and NASDAQ-listed shares. Yet, I continue to struggle to precisely see why this should be the case. Its H1 2017 results showed a company which was doing well across its franchises except neuroscience in which continued destocking in the second quarter of the year pushed it into negative growth (Data source: Q2 2017 Results):  Yet, nothing immediately jumped out as being justification for continued weakness in its share price. After all, excluding the effects of destocking, even neuroscience had seen growth.

As we will see, however, Shire is certainly facing intense competition in some of its core areas. Yet, its success in fresh R&D results, combined with current and potential corporate level changes, suggests Shire is being undervalued right now. For long-term investors, today's somewhat subdued share price seems an ideal opportunity to buy into an increasingly compelling growth story coming from the world’s global leader in rare diseases.

A Hematology Hiatus Coming?

First off, we need to reflect a little on one of the main drivers of Shire’s share price weakness. Chiefly, this has surrounded increasing potential competition in some of its core franchises. This is especially true in its hematology franchise. Picked up as part of its Baxalta acquisition in 2016, it is now the largest revenue generator in the company. Yet, investors are getting a little nervous about potential threats in this area.

The subject has been more thoroughly explored by HealthBlogger last month. Shire has, however, a leading market position in the hematology market. Its ADVATE and ADYNOVATE are approved for use in the treatment of hemophilia without inhibitor (that is, for those patients who have not developed Factor VIII inhibitors). Indeed, ADVATE is the top Factor VIII brand with proven efficacy in the market. Similarly, for those who have developed Factor VIII inhibitors, Shire markets FEIBA which is an anti-inhibitor coagulant or bypassing agent. For Shire, this latter area contributes about 23% of total hematology revenue with the former contributing the lion’s share of the rest (Data source: Q2 2017 Results): However, competition is building. Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY) has seen its emicizumab (ACE910) drug perform well against its primary and all its secondary endpoints in its Phase III trial. As it explained:

The primary endpoint showed a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in treated bleeds of 87% (risk rate [RR]=0.13, p<0.0001) with emicizumab prophylaxis compared with on-demand (no prophylaxis; episodic use only) bypassing agents.
Although Shire and Roche are taking the battle of the treatments through the court, it is clear that should it reach the market (perhaps next year), it poses a sizeable threat to Feiba’s revenue. Shire’s CEO, Flemming Ornskov, argued that, despite reservations, ACE910 could result in hefty market share losses:

While we don't know for sure how much of our approximately $800 million in annual global sales of FEIBA is at risk, and this will most certainly be impacted by the potential approval timing, the final label and the future clinical and real-world data generated from patients, we do think that the market's current expectation for up to 50% share erosion after five years post-launch is reasonable. That said, we believe there will be no one-size-fits-all approach to treating these kinds of patients, and FEIBA will remain an important therapeutic option also in the future.
Roche is also in the process of releasing data on its Phase III trial pitching emicizumab into the hemophilia without inhibitors treatment. Naturally, should this readout be strong, this poses a threat to a far larger part of hematology revenue. Undoubtedly, as HealthBlogger highlighted:

The unmet need in this segment is much lower than in the inhibitor segment, because the factor VIII replacement therapy (i.e. ADVATE) is a high efficacious therapy for these patients, but if the drug will show a similar compelling profile also in this segment, it’s reasonable to assume that Shire will lose additional market share also in this therapeutic indication.
Roche is thus posing a looming and near-term threat to Shire’s strong position in the hematology market. Other competitors are also lining up to take a share of the spoils, however. BioMarin, for instance, has seen strong results from its Phase I/II trial of its BMN 270 gene therapy. Although it still needs to pass through the larger Phase III trial, some believe that BMN 270 could be on the market by 2019. This would undoubtedly put more pressure on Shire’s hematology revenue. With other pharma companies coming up with potential new drugs to take share from Shire’s already on-market drugs, investors are understandably a bit more aware of the potential frailty in its major revenue generator.

Nonetheless, Shire has not been standing still with its own pipeline in the hematology space. Its lanadelumab (SHP643) Phase III trial for heredity angioedema (NYSE:HAE) is showing early signs of strong promise in its primary and secondary endpoints. Shire may well be facing tougher competition in its core hemophilia market, yet its broader hematology franchise appears to be continuing its strong history of advances.

Lialda Laid Low?

Shire has also been facing a tough environment for its ulcerative colitis drug, LIALDA. The drug had become the star of its internal medicine franchise and contributed nearly 6% of total revenue in Q2 2017:

News that Zydus Cadila had been given approval by the FDA to release a generic of the drug, therefore, was hardly well received by investors. The arrival of the LIALDA generic was, as Shire’s CEO Flemming Ornskov noted, “a little earlier than [they] anticipated.”

As a result, this had driven down the revenue predictions for FY 2017 to between $14.3 billion and $14.6 billion (driven, as it explained, primarily by the generics arrival). Despite this, however, it remains the only generic on the market at present and as such Shire believes it can keep its market share fairly healthy. As Ornskov explained:

in a market with one generic competitor and, for the matter, even if there was a second, we think we can maintain a reasonable share of this market in the next few years.
Clearly, however, it will impact upon margins for the drug. What is more, it is hard to argue with Ornskov when he explained that “longer term, [maintaining market share] will become increasingly difficult.”

Although an unwelcome revenue shock, however, Shire remains well-placed in its internal medicine franchise. GATTEX, its drug for short bowel syndrome, saw its constant-currency revenue growth jump 70% in Q2 2017. With Shire directing its LIALDA sales teams to focus on GATTEX, we can expect to see continued strong growth in this drugs revenue contribution. Indeed, its performance should be strong enough to soften the blow coming from the revenue declines seen in the LIALDA business.

The threats to its hematological and LIALDA revenue are certainly something to watch, yet it is important to note that Shire has a great many opportunities facing it which investors have perhaps forgotten in the face of recent news flow.

Ophthalmology Opportunity

Ophthalmology is a new business area. It opened a unit back in May 2014 seeing an opportunity to do as it has done throughout its history: fill a research vacuum in rare and specialty diseases.

XIIDRA (picked up as part of their $160 million acquisition of SARcode in 2013) received approval in July 2016. It was the first drug to treat both the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. This gives it the edge on the established market drug, RESTASIS, already generated strong revenue for Allergan (AGN). XIIDRA also has another benefit over RESTASIS: it works faster.

Unsurprisingly, therefore, XIIDRA has already shown good revenue momentum. As Jeffrey Poulton, Shire’s CFO, noted:

We continue to be pleased with the performance of XIIDRA since launch. XIIDRA contributed $57 million in sales during the quarter, as prescription demand increased 13% from Q1, with market share increasing to approximately 23% by the end of Q2.
Indeed, it has already built up its market share rapidly since it was launched (Data source: Q1 2017 Results Presentation): Yet, here is the thing, this is a huge market share despite the fact that XIIDRA has not yet gained access to a large part of the DED market. As Poulton added at Q1 2017:

Importantly, this very impressive [market share] gain has been primarily driven by our ability to command share in the commercial insurance market, where XIIDRA has broad coverage. In the commercial market alone, our share is, of course, much higher than 22%. As you may know, we do not have broad Medicare coverage yet. I remain optimistic that we will be able to improve access to the Medicare population, who accounts for more than 40% of the current dry eye disease market.
Adding later that:

We’re building this [XIIDRA] brand into a blockbuster like we did with VYVANSE, step-by-step, keeping in mind we have patents until 2029 and expect few potential competitive entrants before XIIDRA’s patent expiry.
What is more, Shire has good pipeline prospects for building a more broad-based ophthalmology franchise. As well as additional DED developments, it has good trial progress in glaucoma and infectious conjunctivitis (Source: Shire Ophthalmology Pipeline in July 2017):",L,1.81

I'm like the man from Texas. You see, the man from Missouri always says, 'You've got to show me.' But the man from Texas says, 'You've got to put it in my hand.'"" —Jack London
Novavax (NASDAQ: NVAX) is a clinical-stage biotech company with an enviable pipeline, including a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a disease that afflicts millions of people around the world. Novavax's maternal RSV vaccine candidate is in the Phase III clinical trial stage. Novavax's work toward a viable RSV vaccine won the backing of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2015, including up to $89 million in grants to support the development and clinical trials of a maternal vaccine.

Novavax's story goes well beyond just one vaccine, with other prospective drugs in the pipeline, including vaccines for the Zika virus and Ebola, as well as a novel nanoparticle flu vaccine that utilizes the company's proprietary Matrix-M adjuvant.

This would all seem to add up to an exceptional story. Unfortunately, there is a very serious hitch: In September 2016, the Phase III clinical trial of Novavax's RSV vaccine for elderly patients, dubbed “Resolve”, laid an egg. The trial failed to meet both its primary and secondary endpoints. The market reacted as one would expect, with Novavax's share price taking a more than 83 percent dive overnight. Since then, the stock has slipped further and now trades around $1.00 per share. That is a far cry from the $8.34 per share posted the day the Resolve trial results were announced.",L,8.0

2017-08-22,CYTK,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/handwriting-on-the-wall-suggests-progress-in-als-may-be-imminent-says-cytokinetics-ceo," 'Writing on the wall' suggests progress in ALS may be imminent, says Cytokinetics CEO","San Franciscan firm Cytokinetics (Nasdaq: CYTK) is pursuing an unusual angle to therapeutic discovery, starting from an understanding of the biology of muscles in order to explore treatment options in different disease areas.

This approach has seen the company develop a diverse pipeline of candidates, in heart failure, in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where lead candidate tirasemtiv is due to read out at Phase III later this year.

Launched 20 years ago, chief executive Robert Blum was with the firm from the start, leading in R&D and ultimately taking the tiller a few years after they went public in 2004.

Commenting on the company’s philosophy, Mr Blum points to: ""A pipeline that builds on one another, in terms of economies in drug discovery and synergies in drug development activities.""

Amgen collaboration in heart failure

As an example, he cites the company’s long-standing collaboration with fellow Californian biotech Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN), which he says has enabled investment in longer shots such as tirasemtiv.

""[Omecamtiv mecarbil] could ultimately be our most valuable program, and that has afforded us some advantages.""

""That's how we can make the commitment, take the risk, on tirasemtiv. Because we have partnered in other programs, most importantly omecamtiv mecarbil, with Amgen.”

“That could ultimately be our most valuable program, and that has afforded us some advantages. This candidate addresses a very large unmet need - high-risk heart failure patients who are recently hospitalized and therefore at high risk of death or readmission.”

“Heart failure is the largest cardiovascular market that is not well served by existing therapies. It's the number one reason why people over the age of 65 are hospitalized and the single largest line item in the pharmacotherapy budget for Medicare.”

Through its collaborations, Cytokinetics has been able to raise primarily non-diutive capital of over $500 million.

The economic potential in one program feeds into the rest of the company’s portfolio.

Mr Blum says: “As the drug went into Phase III it triggered milestone payments that enabled us to co-invest with Amgen to buy up our royalty economics.”

“We then sold a piece of those to generate additional capital, that we could invest in tirasemtiv.”

“I think this is most possible when you can organically build a pipeline by being the leader in one slice of biology. That affords these kinds of opportunities.""

Astellas collaboration in ALS

As well as Amgen, Cytokinetics is partnered with Japan’s Astellas Pharma (TYO: 4503), this time to develop treatments in neuromuscular indications.

While traditional approaches to ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, have sought to combat the condition from the perspective of nerve decay, Cytokinetics is looking at the disease through the prism of muscle biology, “remaining agnostic as to why the nerves may be degenerating.”

Mr Blum says: “We do know that the muscles are ultimately where the action is in the disease. Patients who live with ALS suffer a ruthless decline of muscle function, and typically die within three to four years, of respiratory failure and pneumonia.""

Cytokinetics believes its compound will be able to increase muscle force, empower and delay the time to muscle weakness and fatigue.

Recognizing the high burden of the disease and the high level of unmet need In ALS, Mr Blum says: “We knew that that could provide a very meaningful new opportunity to address the disease in ways unlike any other.""

The deal with Astellas was synergistic, as both companies are operating in the same research space. Mr Blum saw an advantage to combining their programs, as the company is: “making a major commitment to muscle biology, and employing different approaches that we thought to be quite complementary to ours.""

Cytokinetics has sold to Astellas an option on tirasemtiv, which would provide rights to co-develop and co-commercialize the drug outside of North America and Europe, where the American firm retains exclusivity.

Mr Blum says data from a large Phase III trial into the candidate will be presented at the annual International Symposium on ALS/MND, in Boston, in December.

“This is designed to confirm and extend findings from our earlier studies.”

""If the data are positive, we as a company are ready for regulatory filings in the US and Europe by mid-2018 to support our commercial activities. We're intending to commercialize this drug candidate ourselves in North America and Europe.""

Positive regulatory environment for ALS

Of particular interest in this therapeutic area is the recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of Radicava (edaravone), the first new drug in ALS for over two decades.

""The handwriting on the wall suggests that the division of neurology is accelerating review and approval of certain drugs for high unmet need.”

Unusually, the positive decision was the result of the FDA calling on the drugmaker, Japan’s Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma (TYO: 4508), to file for marketing authorization.

Asked whether this suggests a more positive approach toward expediting therapies, including for ALS, Mr Blum says: ""Yes, I think it probably does. The handwriting on the wall suggests that the division of neurology is accelerating review and approval of certain drugs for high unmet need.”

""What was noteworthy about the approval was that the trials seemed to be conflicting in terms of efficacy. I think the FDA was compelled by the fact that the drug appears to be safe, and they approved the drug subject to post-marketing conditions.""

""It's an important advance for the field, to be sure, but I think it will be interesting to see how it will be commercialized, and what the uptake will be.""

Under the stewardship of new FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, the FDA appears to be taking a more proactive approach, including hiring more staff, to bring innovative therapies to patients expeditiously.

Asked about progress at the FDA, Mr Blum says: ""From what I can see, things are moving forward very constructively. I think there's an opportunity for patients, caregivers, regulatory authorities, industry sponsors and everybody to align more on innovation, and create opportunities for new medicines that are truly innovative, to move forward swiftly.""
""I think the changes at the FDA underscore their commitment to the original intent of biopharmaceutical innovation, and that's the most encouraging sign coming out of Washington.""",L,4.42

2017-08-21,BMY,https://www.mesotheliomahelp.org/2017/08/results-opdivo-trial-may-help-mesothelioma-oncologists-identify-patients-will-benefit-drug/,,"In April, MesotheliomaHelp reported on the findings of a phase I clinical trial showing that the five-year survival rate for some lung cancer patients treated with Opdivo (nivolumab), an immunotherapy treatment, was “much higher” than historical data. Now, researchers report that results from a phase III clinical trial may help oncologists determine those lung cancer patients, and possibly, mesothelioma patients, who will benefit from the immuno-oncology drug.

Opdivo, developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, works by blocking the PD-L1 protein and activating the immune system, leading it to attack and kill cancer cells. According to a June 21 press release from The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, a team of researchers led by David Carbone, MD, PhD, of The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer – Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute, found that although the trial did not improve progression-free survival when compared with chemotherapy in the overall population, those patients with a high expression of PD-L1 did benefit.

“The good news is that we discovered that a subset of patients who had both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status did experience a significant benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

Specifically, the researchers report that patients who had “both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status” realized a 75 percent response rate compared to just 16 percent response rate with low mutation burden and low PDL-1. However, the response rates for chemotherapy treatment in these same subsets were nearly the same leading the researchers to conclude that the PDL-1 markers “were selective for immunotherapy.”

Mesothelioma, a rare, asbestos-related cancer of the lining of the lungs, abdomen or heart, is highly aggressive and is resistant to many cancer treatments. The prognosis for mesothelioma patients is usually grim: the average survival time varies from 4 – 18 months after diagnosis. For the close to 3,000 Americans diagnosed with the disease each year, personalized care may bring a breakthrough treatment not previously considered by their physician.

The benefits of personalized care for mesothelioma patients have been proven where researchers have identified genetic biomarkers that reflect the aggressiveness of mesothelioma as well as markers that can assess the effectiveness of a particular treatment.

Opdivo is currently in a phase III clinical trial in the UK for mesothelioma patients. Known as The CheckpOiNt Blockade For Inhibition of Relapsed Mesothelioma, or CONIFRM, the trial has a goal of ‘exploiting the potential of immunotherapy.’

Keytruda, which gained popularity after saving former President Jimmy Carter’s life after sending his melanoma into remission, is also a PD-L1 inhibitor. Both immunotherapy drugs have shown in studies to be effective in fighting pleural mesothelioma. Keytruda is, perhaps, more well known due to eight-year mesothelioma survivor Mavis Nye of England, who went into remission after a two-year clinical trial of the drug.

“This study is an important step toward understanding the impact of tumor mutation burden and PDL-1 in immunotherapy response. This data shows we should evaluate these two factors independently to most accurately define who will benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

About Recro Pharma, Inc.

Recro is a specialty pharmaceutical company that operates through two business divisions, an Acute Care, hospital product division and a revenue-generating contract development and manufacturing, or CDMO division, located at the Company's Gainesville facility. The Acute Care division is primarily focused on developing innovative products for hospital and other acute care settings. The Company's lead product candidate is a proprietary injectable form of meloxicam, a long-acting preferential COX-2 inhibitor. IV meloxicam 30mg has successfully completed two pivotal Phase III clinical efficacy trials in patients following bunionectomy and abdominoplasty surgeries, a large double blind Phase III safety trial, four Phase II clinical trials for the management of moderate to severe post-operative pain, as well as other safety studies. As injectable meloxicam is in the non-opioid class of drugs, the Company believes it will overcome many of the issues associated with commonly prescribed opioid therapeutics, including respiratory depression, constipation, excessive nausea and vomiting, as well as having no addictive potential while maintaining meaningful analgesic effects for relief of pain. The Company's CDMO division leverages its formulation expertise to develop and manufacture pharmaceutical products using its proprietary delivery technologies and other manufacturing services for commercial partners who commercialize or plan to commercialize these products. These collaborations can result in revenue streams including royalties, profit sharing, research and development and manufacturing fees, which support continued operations for its CDMO division and it contributes non-dilutive funding for the development and pre-commercialization activities of its Acute Care division.

2017-08-21,IRWD,https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Ironwood+Pharma+%28IRWD%29+Announces+FDA+Approval+of+DUZALLO+for+Treatment+of+Hyperuricemia+in+Patients+with+Uncontrolled+Gout/13222622.html,,"Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IRWD) today announced DUZALLO was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a once-daily oral treatment for hyperuricemia associated with gout in patients who have not achieved target serum uric acid (sUA) levels with a medically appropriate daily dose of allopurinol alone. DUZALLO is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Ironwood expects DUZALLO to be commercially available early in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Gout is a highly symptomatic and painful form of inflammatory arthritis caused by hyperuricemia, or elevated sUA levels in the blood, which can lead to painful flares and serious potential long-term health consequences.DUZALLO is the first drug that combines the current standard of care for the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout, allopurinol, with the most recent FDA-approved treatment for this condition, lesinurad. This fixed-dose combination provides a dual mechanism of action in a single tablet that can address both underlying causes of hyperuricemia – overproduction and underexcretion of serum uric acid.

“The approval of DUZALLO provides a new fixed-dose and dual-mechanism treatment option to help patients with uncontrolled gout achieve target serum uric acid levels. This represents an important and needed new option in the treatment of hyperuricemia,” said Michael A. Becker, M.D., professor emeritus of medicine, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL. “Gout is a serious and potentially progressive and debilitating inflammatory disease. Getting patients with gout to serum urate goal, and keeping them at or below goal, are essential to success in treating these patients. DUZALLO will help reduce the significant unmet need among patients in the U.S. who fail to get their serum uric acid levels to goal despite taking allopurinol alone.”

“With DUZALLO, nearly twice as many patients with uncontrolled gout may be able to achieve target serum uric acid levels compared to those patients taking allopurinol alone, which is important, considering the significant unmet need among uncontrolled gout patients to get to goal of under 6 mg/dL,” said Tom McCourt, senior vice president of marketing and sales and chief commercial officer at Ironwood. “We believe DUZALLO will be the critical driver behind Ironwood’s gout franchise, which is expected to exceed total annual U.S. peak sales of $300 million.”",L,2.65
2017-08-21,NVO,https://www.gurufocus.com/news/556495/3-companies-aiming-to-significantly-reduce-diabetes-treatment-costs,,"Total U.S. health care spending in 2015 was an astronomical $3.2 trillion. That is 16% of the entire national debt. As much as we blame the prices of new drugs for this gargantuan sum, one of the biggest chunks of it comes from diabetes, a disease whose treatment has not changed all that much since 1922. According to the American Diabetes Association, diabetes accounts for $322 billion in total U.S. health care spending as of 2016.

One Harvard study puts the annual cost at a much higher $822 billion annually. Whichever number you want to believe, it is among the costliest diseases in the world, for both patients and taxpayers. Thanks to Medicare and Medicaid, diabetes costs are socialized.



There are two reasons for the rising costs. First, the price of insulin has tripled since 2002. Second, the nature of lifetime treatment necessitates ever-rising doses of insulin as the disease progresses.

Novo Nordisk and semaglutide

Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) recently announced its once-weekly GLP-1 agonist semaglutide handily beat Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide in terms of weight loss and blood sugar control in a pivotal Phase III trial. GLP-1 agonists, unlike insulin, stimulate pancreatic cells to produce insulin in a glucose-dependent manner. Meaning, GLP-1 agonists only induce native insulin production when blood glucose levels are high enough to trigger it. This is much more convenient than manually measuring blood sugar before injecting insulin directly.

While markets are focused on the one-on-one beat, raising Novo shares at the expense of Eli Lilly’s, there is potentially more exciting news regarding semaglutide yet to come. Novo Nordisk has already demonstrated in a Phase II trial that an oral formulation of semaglutide can work as well. If this continues into Phase III, the implication could be big for diabetes treatment costs. Oral formulations of otherwise intravenous drugs increase patient compliance and, if it works better than GLP-1 agonists currently on the market, it could keep diabetes patients healthier for longer, reducing long-run costs as the disease progresses, by far the costliest aspect of diabetes.

Roche and the artificial pancreas

Another innovative way to increase patient compliance and reduce long-run costs is to simply automate everything. Roche Holding AG (RHHBY) is currently sponsoring a late-stage development of an artificial pancreas that uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology together with an insulin pump to keep diabetics’ blood sugar in perpetual balance.

A pivotal Phase III trial was announced late last month, cosponsored by Roche Diabetics Care Inc. The ingenious closed-loop system uses a smartphone app to notify patients when blood sugar levels go out of range of preset limits. Since most of the damage from diabetes occurs when patients are out of their blood sugar target ranges, by keeping diabetics range-bound for longer, and hopefully perpetually, much of the cumulative damage from diabetes can hopefully be blunted or maybe even prevented for the long run. This closed-loop artificial pancreas is currently intended for Type 1 diabetics, though if successful it may be trialed for the much more prevalent Type 2 population.

Oramed and oral insulin

Perhaps the most ambitious of new diabetes treatments is an oral insulin formulation from Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ORMP). Oramed just recently announced a planned Phase III trial for what has been termed the holy grail of diabetes treatments.

Oral insulin could fundamentally change the entire diabetes playing field since it would change the way insulin interacts with blood glucose and make the process more akin to what occurs in healthy people. Oramed is using similar technology to what Novo Nordisk is using in its own oral GLP-1 treatment, so there is reason to believe it could actually work.

Oral insulin could get prediabetics on insulin earlier since injecting insulin daily is not only inconvenient but almost taboo and a last resort. Getting prediabetics on insulin faster could go a long way in reducing late-stage complications as the disease progresses and insulin resistance sets in.

There is reason to believe insulin resistance – the factor that necessitates ever-higher doses of insulin and where most of the costs lay - will be less of a problem with an oral formulation because oral insulin goes through the liver, which is the natural organ for regulating insulin release once it receives it from the pancreas. It is a way of having the body naturally regulate insulin release rather than having to measure the dose via blood sugar analysis constantly.

All or any success amongst these three companies could take a significant bite out of overall diabetes costs over the next decade and beyond. Diabetes is by far the costliest health care niche and badly in need of a major advance. With three companies with potentially paradigm-shifting treatments in the pipe, chances are we will see that major advance before the close of this decade and before diabetes costs spiral completely out of control, if they have not done so already.",L,1.03

There is reason to believe insulin resistance – the factor that necessitates ever-higher doses of insulin and where most of the costs lay - will be less of a problem with an oral formulation because oral insulin goes through the liver, which is the natural organ for regulating insulin release once it receives it from the pancreas. It is a way of having the body naturally regulate insulin release rather than having to measure the dose via blood sugar analysis constantly.

2017-08-21,LLY,https://www.gurufocus.com/news/556495/3-companies-aiming-to-significantly-reduce-diabetes-treatment-costs,,"Total U.S. health care spending in 2015 was an astronomical $3.2 trillion. That is 16% of the entire national debt. As much as we blame the prices of new drugs for this gargantuan sum, one of the biggest chunks of it comes from diabetes, a disease whose treatment has not changed all that much since 1922. According to the American Diabetes Association, diabetes accounts for $322 billion in total U.S. health care spending as of 2016.

One Harvard study puts the annual cost at a much higher $822 billion annually. Whichever number you want to believe, it is among the costliest diseases in the world, for both patients and taxpayers. Thanks to Medicare and Medicaid, diabetes costs are socialized.



There are two reasons for the rising costs. First, the price of insulin has tripled since 2002. Second, the nature of lifetime treatment necessitates ever-rising doses of insulin as the disease progresses.

Short of hoping Americans radically change their diets overnight and drastically reduce sugar intake, the problem is not going away. But there is hope for significant cost reduction nonetheless. Here are three companies on the cutting edge of the newest diabetes advancements that, with some luck, may help reduce this nearly unfathomable cost to the U.S. economy and taxpayers.

Novo Nordisk and semaglutide

Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) recently announced its once-weekly GLP-1 agonist semaglutide handily beat Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide in terms of weight loss and blood sugar control in a pivotal Phase III trial. GLP-1 agonists, unlike insulin, stimulate pancreatic cells to produce insulin in a glucose-dependent manner. Meaning, GLP-1 agonists only induce native insulin production when blood glucose levels are high enough to trigger it. This is much more convenient than manually measuring blood sugar before injecting insulin directly.

While markets are focused on the one-on-one beat, raising Novo shares at the expense of Eli Lilly’s, there is potentially more exciting news regarding semaglutide yet to come. Novo Nordisk has already demonstrated in a Phase II trial that an oral formulation of semaglutide can work as well. If this continues into Phase III, the implication could be big for diabetes treatment costs. Oral formulations of otherwise intravenous drugs increase patient compliance and, if it works better than GLP-1 agonists currently on the market, it could keep diabetes patients healthier for longer, reducing long-run costs as the disease progresses, by far the costliest aspect of diabetes.

Roche and the artificial pancreas

Another innovative way to increase patient compliance and reduce long-run costs is to simply automate everything. Roche Holding AG (RHHBY) is currently sponsoring a late-stage development of an artificial pancreas that uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology together with an insulin pump to keep diabetics’ blood sugar in perpetual balance.

A pivotal Phase III trial was announced late last month, cosponsored by Roche Diabetics Care Inc. The ingenious closed-loop system uses a smartphone app to notify patients when blood sugar levels go out of range of preset limits. Since most of the damage from diabetes occurs when patients are out of their blood sugar target ranges, by keeping diabetics range-bound for longer, and hopefully perpetually, much of the cumulative damage from diabetes can hopefully be blunted or maybe even prevented for the long run. This closed-loop artificial pancreas is currently intended for Type 1 diabetics, though if successful it may be trialed for the much more prevalent Type 2 population.

Oramed and oral insulin

Perhaps the most ambitious of new diabetes treatments is an oral insulin formulation from Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ORMP). Oramed just recently announced a planned Phase III trial for what has been termed the holy grail of diabetes treatments.

Oral insulin could fundamentally change the entire diabetes playing field since it would change the way insulin interacts with blood glucose and make the process more akin to what occurs in healthy people. Oramed is using similar technology to what Novo Nordisk is using in its own oral GLP-1 treatment, so there is reason to believe it could actually work.

Oral insulin could get prediabetics on insulin earlier since injecting insulin daily is not only inconvenient but almost taboo and a last resort. Getting prediabetics on insulin faster could go a long way in reducing late-stage complications as the disease progresses and insulin resistance sets in.

2017-08-22,SHPG,,"Shire: At 52-Week Low, Long-Term Opportunity Appears Significant","Shire's share price has been languishing near 52-week lows for a little while now.

Despite valid concerns about the prospect of intense competition in its important hematology franchise, the business remains attractive.

New assets in ophthalmology and oncology are generating strong results already, and additional assets look set to continue the trend.

Baxalta deal is also going well, and the potential exit from neuroscience should consolidate its reputation as the rare disease specialist at a time when orphan drug growth is expected to grow rapidly.

Combined with a highly cash-generative and healthy business, Shire looks very attractive for long-term investors right now. Shire’s* (SHPG) share price recently hit a 52-week low in both its London- and NASDAQ-listed shares. Yet, I continue to struggle to precisely see why this should be the case. Its H1 2017 results showed a company which was doing well across its franchises except neuroscience in which continued destocking in the second quarter of the year pushed it into negative growth (Data source: Q2 2017 Results):  Yet, nothing immediately jumped out as being justification for continued weakness in its share price. After all, excluding the effects of destocking, even neuroscience had seen growth.

As we will see, however, Shire is certainly facing intense competition in some of its core areas. Yet, its success in fresh R&D results, combined with current and potential corporate level changes, suggests Shire is being undervalued right now. For long-term investors, today's somewhat subdued share price seems an ideal opportunity to buy into an increasingly compelling growth story coming from the world’s global leader in rare diseases.

A Hematology Hiatus Coming?

First off, we need to reflect a little on one of the main drivers of Shire’s share price weakness. Chiefly, this has surrounded increasing potential competition in some of its core franchises. This is especially true in its hematology franchise. Picked up as part of its Baxalta acquisition in 2016, it is now the largest revenue generator in the company. Yet, investors are getting a little nervous about potential threats in this area.

The subject has been more thoroughly explored by HealthBlogger last month. Shire has, however, a leading market position in the hematology market. Its ADVATE and ADYNOVATE are approved for use in the treatment of hemophilia without inhibitor (that is, for those patients who have not developed Factor VIII inhibitors). Indeed, ADVATE is the top Factor VIII brand with proven efficacy in the market. Similarly, for those who have developed Factor VIII inhibitors, Shire markets FEIBA which is an anti-inhibitor coagulant or bypassing agent. For Shire, this latter area contributes about 23% of total hematology revenue with the former contributing the lion’s share of the rest (Data source: Q2 2017 Results): However, competition is building. Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY) has seen its emicizumab (ACE910) drug perform well against its primary and all its secondary endpoints in its Phase III trial. As it explained:

The primary endpoint showed a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in treated bleeds of 87% (risk rate [RR]=0.13, p<0.0001) with emicizumab prophylaxis compared with on-demand (no prophylaxis; episodic use only) bypassing agents.
Although Shire and Roche are taking the battle of the treatments through the court, it is clear that should it reach the market (perhaps next year), it poses a sizeable threat to Feiba’s revenue. Shire’s CEO, Flemming Ornskov, argued that, despite reservations, ACE910 could result in hefty market share losses:

While we don't know for sure how much of our approximately $800 million in annual global sales of FEIBA is at risk, and this will most certainly be impacted by the potential approval timing, the final label and the future clinical and real-world data generated from patients, we do think that the market's current expectation for up to 50% share erosion after five years post-launch is reasonable. That said, we believe there will be no one-size-fits-all approach to treating these kinds of patients, and FEIBA will remain an important therapeutic option also in the future.
Roche is also in the process of releasing data on its Phase III trial pitching emicizumab into the hemophilia without inhibitors treatment. Naturally, should this readout be strong, this poses a threat to a far larger part of hematology revenue. Undoubtedly, as HealthBlogger highlighted:

The unmet need in this segment is much lower than in the inhibitor segment, because the factor VIII replacement therapy (i.e. ADVATE) is a high efficacious therapy for these patients, but if the drug will show a similar compelling profile also in this segment, it’s reasonable to assume that Shire will lose additional market share also in this therapeutic indication.
Roche is thus posing a looming and near-term threat to Shire’s strong position in the hematology market. Other competitors are also lining up to take a share of the spoils, however. BioMarin, for instance, has seen strong results from its Phase I/II trial of its BMN 270 gene therapy. Although it still needs to pass through the larger Phase III trial, some believe that BMN 270 could be on the market by 2019. This would undoubtedly put more pressure on Shire’s hematology revenue. With other pharma companies coming up with potential new drugs to take share from Shire’s already on-market drugs, investors are understandably a bit more aware of the potential frailty in its major revenue generator.

Nonetheless, Shire has not been standing still with its own pipeline in the hematology space. Its lanadelumab (SHP643) Phase III trial for heredity angioedema (NYSE:HAE) is showing early signs of strong promise in its primary and secondary endpoints. Shire may well be facing tougher competition in its core hemophilia market, yet its broader hematology franchise appears to be continuing its strong history of advances.

Lialda Laid Low?

Shire has also been facing a tough environment for its ulcerative colitis drug, LIALDA. The drug had become the star of its internal medicine franchise and contributed nearly 6% of total revenue in Q2 2017:

News that Zydus Cadila had been given approval by the FDA to release a generic of the drug, therefore, was hardly well received by investors. The arrival of the LIALDA generic was, as Shire’s CEO Flemming Ornskov noted, “a little earlier than [they] anticipated.”

As a result, this had driven down the revenue predictions for FY 2017 to between $14.3 billion and $14.6 billion (driven, as it explained, primarily by the generics arrival). Despite this, however, it remains the only generic on the market at present and as such Shire believes it can keep its market share fairly healthy. As Ornskov explained:

in a market with one generic competitor and, for the matter, even if there was a second, we think we can maintain a reasonable share of this market in the next few years.
Clearly, however, it will impact upon margins for the drug. What is more, it is hard to argue with Ornskov when he explained that “longer term, [maintaining market share] will become increasingly difficult.”

Although an unwelcome revenue shock, however, Shire remains well-placed in its internal medicine franchise. GATTEX, its drug for short bowel syndrome, saw its constant-currency revenue growth jump 70% in Q2 2017. With Shire directing its LIALDA sales teams to focus on GATTEX, we can expect to see continued strong growth in this drugs revenue contribution. Indeed, its performance should be strong enough to soften the blow coming from the revenue declines seen in the LIALDA business.

The threats to its hematological and LIALDA revenue are certainly something to watch, yet it is important to note that Shire has a great many opportunities facing it which investors have perhaps forgotten in the face of recent news flow.

Ophthalmology Opportunity

Ophthalmology is a new business area. It opened a unit back in May 2014 seeing an opportunity to do as it has done throughout its history: fill a research vacuum in rare and specialty diseases.

XIIDRA (picked up as part of their $160 million acquisition of SARcode in 2013) received approval in July 2016. It was the first drug to treat both the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. This gives it the edge on the established market drug, RESTASIS, already generated strong revenue for Allergan (AGN). XIIDRA also has another benefit over RESTASIS: it works faster.

Unsurprisingly, therefore, XIIDRA has already shown good revenue momentum. As Jeffrey Poulton, Shire’s CFO, noted:

We continue to be pleased with the performance of XIIDRA since launch. XIIDRA contributed $57 million in sales during the quarter, as prescription demand increased 13% from Q1, with market share increasing to approximately 23% by the end of Q2.
Indeed, it has already built up its market share rapidly since it was launched (Data source: Q1 2017 Results Presentation): Yet, here is the thing, this is a huge market share despite the fact that XIIDRA has not yet gained access to a large part of the DED market. As Poulton added at Q1 2017:

Importantly, this very impressive [market share] gain has been primarily driven by our ability to command share in the commercial insurance market, where XIIDRA has broad coverage. In the commercial market alone, our share is, of course, much higher than 22%. As you may know, we do not have broad Medicare coverage yet. I remain optimistic that we will be able to improve access to the Medicare population, who accounts for more than 40% of the current dry eye disease market.
Adding later that:

We’re building this [XIIDRA] brand into a blockbuster like we did with VYVANSE, step-by-step, keeping in mind we have patents until 2029 and expect few potential competitive entrants before XIIDRA’s patent expiry.
What is more, Shire has good pipeline prospects for building a more broad-based ophthalmology franchise. As well as additional DED developments, it has good trial progress in glaucoma and infectious conjunctivitis (Source: Shire Ophthalmology Pipeline in July 2017):",L,1.81

Novavax's work toward a viable RSV vaccine won the backing of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2015, including up to $89 million in grants to support the development and clinical trials of a maternal vaccine.

Novavax's story goes well beyond just one vaccine, with other prospective drugs in the pipeline, including vaccines for the Zika virus and Ebola, as well as a novel nanoparticle flu vaccine that utilizes the company's proprietary Matrix-M adjuvant.

This would all seem to add up to an exceptional story. Unfortunately, there is a very serious hitch: In September 2016, the Phase III clinical trial of Novavax's RSV vaccine for elderly patients, dubbed “Resolve”, laid an egg. The trial failed to meet both its primary and secondary endpoints. The market reacted as one would expect, with Novavax's share price taking a more than 83 percent dive overnight. Since then, the stock has slipped further and now trades around $1.00 per share. That is a far cry from the $8.34 per share posted the day the Resolve trial results were announced.",L,8.0

My last report focused on ABO-102 for sanfilippo syndrome type A, which I believe may be worth $30 - $60/ share.  Recent clinical trial data continues to support that view.

This report focuses on EB-101, a gene therapy for Epidermolysis Bullosa, a rare skin disorder that inflicts terrible levels of morbidity and mortality.

If successfully commercialized, EB-101 could easily generate cashflows with NPV > $60/ share also.  I expect a small phase III confirmatory study to commence in 1Q18.

Abeona - a ""String of Pearls"" Strategy with each Pearl Potentially Worth >$30/ share in NPV

Abeona (ABEO) is a small cap biotech company that I have written about in the past (see Abeona: Preparing For Liftoff - The Next AveXis?). In my opinion, this stock has the potential to be >$100/ share in 24-36 months, driven by the commercialization of five gene therapy products for rare diseases that currently have no available treatment options.

My last report, published in February, provided a detailed analysis of the company's initial gene therapy product, ABO-102, which is in clinical trials for San Filippo Syndrome Type A. This company uses an identical AAV9 vector to that employed by AveXis (AVXS) for their SMA gene therapy product. Initial data from the first six patients is extremely encouraging demonstrating a dose response in biomarkers (such as urinary GAG and CSF GAG) and suggestive evidence that the patients are experiencing a neurocognitive benefit. In fact, the clinical trial data presented during the past six months on this product really couldn't have been any better. You can read about this product in my initial report and see the initial clinical trial data in the company presentation. Without knowing pricing strategy or the outlook for reimbursement in my last report I suggested that future cash flows from this product alone likely have an NPV of $1.5bn - $3bn, equivalent to $30 - $60/share.",W,27.39
2017-08-22,CYTK,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/handwriting-on-the-wall-suggests-progress-in-als-may-be-imminent-says-cytokinetics-ceo," 'Writing on the wall' suggests progress in ALS may be imminent, says Cytokinetics CEO","San Franciscan firm Cytokinetics (Nasdaq: CYTK) is pursuing an unusual angle to therapeutic discovery, starting from an understanding of the biology of muscles in order to explore treatment options in different disease areas.

This approach has seen the company develop a diverse pipeline of candidates, in heart failure, in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where lead candidate tirasemtiv is due to read out at Phase III later this year.

Launched 20 years ago, chief executive Robert Blum was with the firm from the start, leading in R&D and ultimately taking the tiller a few years after they went public in 2004.

Commenting on the company’s philosophy, Mr Blum points to: ""A pipeline that builds on one another, in terms of economies in drug discovery and synergies in drug development activities.""

Amgen collaboration in heart failure

As an example, he cites the company’s long-standing collaboration with fellow Californian biotech Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN), which he says has enabled investment in longer shots such as tirasemtiv.

""[Omecamtiv mecarbil] could ultimately be our most valuable program, and that has afforded us some advantages.""

""That's how we can make the commitment, take the risk, on tirasemtiv. Because we have partnered in other programs, most importantly omecamtiv mecarbil, with Amgen.”

“That could ultimately be our most valuable program, and that has afforded us some advantages. This candidate addresses a very large unmet need - high-risk heart failure patients who are recently hospitalized and therefore at high risk of death or readmission.”

“Heart failure is the largest cardiovascular market that is not well served by existing therapies. It's the number one reason why people over the age of 65 are hospitalized and the single largest line item in the pharmacotherapy budget for Medicare.”

Through its collaborations, Cytokinetics has been able to raise primarily non-diutive capital of over $500 million.

The economic potential in one program feeds into the rest of the company’s portfolio.

Mr Blum says: “As the drug went into Phase III it triggered milestone payments that enabled us to co-invest with Amgen to buy up our royalty economics.”

“We then sold a piece of those to generate additional capital, that we could invest in tirasemtiv.”

“I think this is most possible when you can organically build a pipeline by being the leader in one slice of biology. That affords these kinds of opportunities.""

Astellas collaboration in ALS

As well as Amgen, Cytokinetics is partnered with Japan’s Astellas Pharma (TYO: 4503), this time to develop treatments in neuromuscular indications.

While traditional approaches to ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, have sought to combat the condition from the perspective of nerve decay, Cytokinetics is looking at the disease through the prism of muscle biology, “remaining agnostic as to why the nerves may be degenerating.”

Mr Blum says: “We do know that the muscles are ultimately where the action is in the disease. Patients who live with ALS suffer a ruthless decline of muscle function, and typically die within three to four years, of respiratory failure and pneumonia.""

Cytokinetics believes its compound will be able to increase muscle force, empower and delay the time to muscle weakness and fatigue.

Recognizing the high burden of the disease and the high level of unmet need In ALS, Mr Blum says: “We knew that that could provide a very meaningful new opportunity to address the disease in ways unlike any other.""

The deal with Astellas was synergistic, as both companies are operating in the same research space. Mr Blum saw an advantage to combining their programs, as the company is: “making a major commitment to muscle biology, and employing different approaches that we thought to be quite complementary to ours.""

Cytokinetics has sold to Astellas an option on tirasemtiv, which would provide rights to co-develop and co-commercialize the drug outside of North America and Europe, where the American firm retains exclusivity.

Mr Blum says data from a large Phase III trial into the candidate will be presented at the annual International Symposium on ALS/MND, in Boston, in December.

“This is designed to confirm and extend findings from our earlier studies.”

""If the data are positive, we as a company are ready for regulatory filings in the US and Europe by mid-2018 to support our commercial activities. We're intending to commercialize this drug candidate ourselves in North America and Europe.""

Positive regulatory environment for ALS

Of particular interest in this therapeutic area is the recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of Radicava (edaravone), the first new drug in ALS for over two decades.

""The handwriting on the wall suggests that the division of neurology is accelerating review and approval of certain drugs for high unmet need.”

Unusually, the positive decision was the result of the FDA calling on the drugmaker, Japan’s Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma (TYO: 4508), to file for marketing authorization.

Asked whether this suggests a more positive approach toward expediting therapies, including for ALS, Mr Blum says: ""Yes, I think it probably does. The handwriting on the wall suggests that the division of neurology is accelerating review and approval of certain drugs for high unmet need.”

""What was noteworthy about the approval was that the trials seemed to be conflicting in terms of efficacy. I think the FDA was compelled by the fact that the drug appears to be safe, and they approved the drug subject to post-marketing conditions.""

""It's an important advance for the field, to be sure, but I think it will be interesting to see how it will be commercialized, and what the uptake will be.""

Under the stewardship of new FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, the FDA appears to be taking a more proactive approach, including hiring more staff, to bring innovative therapies to patients expeditiously.

Asked about progress at the FDA, Mr Blum says: ""From what I can see, things are moving forward very constructively. I think there's an opportunity for patients, caregivers, regulatory authorities, industry sponsors and everybody to align more on innovation, and create opportunities for new medicines that are truly innovative, to move forward swiftly.""
""I think the changes at the FDA underscore their commitment to the original intent of biopharmaceutical innovation, and that's the most encouraging sign coming out of Washington.""",L,4.42

2017-08-21,BMY,https://www.mesotheliomahelp.org/2017/08/results-opdivo-trial-may-help-mesothelioma-oncologists-identify-patients-will-benefit-drug/,,"In April, MesotheliomaHelp reported on the findings of a phase I clinical trial showing that the five-year survival rate for some lung cancer patients treated with Opdivo (nivolumab), an immunotherapy treatment, was “much higher” than historical data. Now, researchers report that results from a phase III clinical trial may help oncologists determine those lung cancer patients, and possibly, mesothelioma patients, who will benefit from the immuno-oncology drug.

Opdivo, developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, works by blocking the PD-L1 protein and activating the immune system, leading it to attack and kill cancer cells. According to a June 21 press release from The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, a team of researchers led by David Carbone, MD, PhD, of The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer – Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute, found that although the trial did not improve progression-free survival when compared with chemotherapy in the overall population, those patients with a high expression of PD-L1 did benefit.

“The good news is that we discovered that a subset of patients who had both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status did experience a significant benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

Specifically, the researchers report that patients who had “both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status” realized a 75 percent response rate compared to just 16 percent response rate with low mutation burden and low PDL-1. However, the response rates for chemotherapy treatment in these same subsets were nearly the same leading the researchers to conclude that the PDL-1 markers “were selective for immunotherapy.”

Mesothelioma, a rare, asbestos-related cancer of the lining of the lungs, abdomen or heart, is highly aggressive and is resistant to many cancer treatments. The prognosis for mesothelioma patients is usually grim: the average survival time varies from 4 – 18 months after diagnosis. For the close to 3,000 Americans diagnosed with the disease each year, personalized care may bring a breakthrough treatment not previously considered by their physician.

The benefits of personalized care for mesothelioma patients have been proven where researchers have identified genetic biomarkers that reflect the aggressiveness of mesothelioma as well as markers that can assess the effectiveness of a particular treatment.

Opdivo is currently in a phase III clinical trial in the UK for mesothelioma patients. Known as The CheckpOiNt Blockade For Inhibition of Relapsed Mesothelioma, or CONIFRM, the trial has a goal of ‘exploiting the potential of immunotherapy.’

Keytruda, which gained popularity after saving former President Jimmy Carter’s life after sending his melanoma into remission, is also a PD-L1 inhibitor. Both immunotherapy drugs have shown in studies to be effective in fighting pleural mesothelioma. Keytruda is, perhaps, more well known due to eight-year mesothelioma survivor Mavis Nye of England, who went into remission after a two-year clinical trial of the drug.

“This study is an important step toward understanding the impact of tumor mutation burden and PDL-1 in immunotherapy response. This data shows we should evaluate these two factors independently to most accurately define who will benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

About Recro Pharma, Inc.

Recro is a specialty pharmaceutical company that operates through two business divisions, an Acute Care, hospital product division and a revenue-generating contract development and manufacturing, or CDMO division, located at the Company's Gainesville facility. The Acute Care division is primarily focused on developing innovative products for hospital and other acute care settings. The Company's lead product candidate is a proprietary injectable form of meloxicam, a long-acting preferential COX-2 inhibitor. IV meloxicam 30mg has successfully completed two pivotal Phase III clinical efficacy trials in patients following bunionectomy and abdominoplasty surgeries, a large double blind Phase III safety trial, four Phase II clinical trials for the management of moderate to severe post-operative pain, as well as other safety studies. As injectable meloxicam is in the non-opioid class of drugs, the Company believes it will overcome many of the issues associated with commonly prescribed opioid therapeutics, including respiratory depression, constipation, excessive nausea and vomiting, as well as having no addictive potential while maintaining meaningful analgesic effects for relief of pain. The Company's CDMO division leverages its formulation expertise to develop and manufacture pharmaceutical products using its proprietary delivery technologies and other manufacturing services for commercial partners who commercialize or plan to commercialize these products. These collaborations can result in revenue streams including royalties, profit sharing, research and development and manufacturing fees, which support continued operations for its CDMO division and it contributes non-dilutive funding for the development and pre-commercialization activities of its Acute Care division.

2017-08-21,IRWD,https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Ironwood+Pharma+%28IRWD%29+Announces+FDA+Approval+of+DUZALLO+for+Treatment+of+Hyperuricemia+in+Patients+with+Uncontrolled+Gout/13222622.html,,"Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IRWD) today announced DUZALLO was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a once-daily oral treatment for hyperuricemia associated with gout in patients who have not achieved target serum uric acid (sUA) levels with a medically appropriate daily dose of allopurinol alone. DUZALLO is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Ironwood expects DUZALLO to be commercially available early in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Gout is a highly symptomatic and painful form of inflammatory arthritis caused by hyperuricemia, or elevated sUA levels in the blood, which can lead to painful flares and serious potential long-term health consequences.DUZALLO is the first drug that combines the current standard of care for the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout, allopurinol, with the most recent FDA-approved treatment for this condition, lesinurad. This fixed-dose combination provides a dual mechanism of action in a single tablet that can address both underlying causes of hyperuricemia – overproduction and underexcretion of serum uric acid.

“The approval of DUZALLO provides a new fixed-dose and dual-mechanism treatment option to help patients with uncontrolled gout achieve target serum uric acid levels. This represents an important and needed new option in the treatment of hyperuricemia,” said Michael A. Becker, M.D., professor emeritus of medicine, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL. “Gout is a serious and potentially progressive and debilitating inflammatory disease. Getting patients with gout to serum urate goal, and keeping them at or below goal, are essential to success in treating these patients. DUZALLO will help reduce the significant unmet need among patients in the U.S. who fail to get their serum uric acid levels to goal despite taking allopurinol alone.”

“With DUZALLO, nearly twice as many patients with uncontrolled gout may be able to achieve target serum uric acid levels compared to those patients taking allopurinol alone, which is important, considering the significant unmet need among uncontrolled gout patients to get to goal of under 6 mg/dL,” said Tom McCourt, senior vice president of marketing and sales and chief commercial officer at Ironwood. “We believe DUZALLO will be the critical driver behind Ironwood’s gout franchise, which is expected to exceed total annual U.S. peak sales of $300 million.”",L,2.65
2017-08-21,NVO,https://www.gurufocus.com/news/556495/3-companies-aiming-to-significantly-reduce-diabetes-treatment-costs,,"Total U.S. health care spending in 2015 was an astronomical $3.2 trillion. That is 16% of the entire national debt. As much as we blame the prices of new drugs for this gargantuan sum, one of the biggest chunks of it comes from diabetes, a disease whose treatment has not changed all that much since 1922. According to the American Diabetes Association, diabetes accounts for $322 billion in total U.S. health care spending as of 2016.

One Harvard study puts the annual cost at a much higher $822 billion annually. Whichever number you want to believe, it is among the costliest diseases in the world, for both patients and taxpayers. Thanks to Medicare and Medicaid, diabetes costs are socialized.



There are two reasons for the rising costs. First, the price of insulin has tripled since 2002. Second, the nature of lifetime treatment necessitates ever-rising doses of insulin as the disease progresses.

Short of hoping Americans radically change their diets overnight and drastically reduce sugar intake, the problem is not going away. But there is hope for significant cost reduction nonetheless. Here are three companies on the cutting edge of the newest diabetes advancements that, with some luck, may help reduce this nearly unfathomable cost to the U.S. economy and taxpayers.

NVO 30-Year Financial Data
The intrinsic value of NVO
Peter Lynch Chart of NVO
Novo Nordisk and semaglutide

Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) recently announced its once-weekly GLP-1 agonist semaglutide handily beat Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide in terms of weight loss and blood sugar control in a pivotal Phase III trial. GLP-1 agonists, unlike insulin, stimulate pancreatic cells to produce insulin in a glucose-dependent manner. Meaning, GLP-1 agonists only induce native insulin production when blood glucose levels are high enough to trigger it. This is much more convenient than manually measuring blood sugar before injecting insulin directly.

While markets are focused on the one-on-one beat, raising Novo shares at the expense of Eli Lilly’s, there is potentially more exciting news regarding semaglutide yet to come. Novo Nordisk has already demonstrated in a Phase II trial that an oral formulation of semaglutide can work as well. If this continues into Phase III, the implication could be big for diabetes treatment costs. Oral formulations of otherwise intravenous drugs increase patient compliance and, if it works better than GLP-1 agonists currently on the market, it could keep diabetes patients healthier for longer, reducing long-run costs as the disease progresses, by far the costliest aspect of diabetes.

Roche and the artificial pancreas

Another innovative way to increase patient compliance and reduce long-run costs is to simply automate everything. Roche Holding AG (RHHBY) is currently sponsoring a late-stage development of an artificial pancreas that uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology together with an insulin pump to keep diabetics’ blood sugar in perpetual balance.

A pivotal Phase III trial was announced late last month, cosponsored by Roche Diabetics Care Inc. The ingenious closed-loop system uses a smartphone app to notify patients when blood sugar levels go out of range of preset limits. Since most of the damage from diabetes occurs when patients are out of their blood sugar target ranges, by keeping diabetics range-bound for longer, and hopefully perpetually, much of the cumulative damage from diabetes can hopefully be blunted or maybe even prevented for the long run. This closed-loop artificial pancreas is currently intended for Type 1 diabetics, though if successful it may be trialed for the much more prevalent Type 2 population.

Oramed and oral insulin

Perhaps the most ambitious of new diabetes treatments is an oral insulin formulation from Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ORMP). Oramed just recently announced a planned Phase III trial for what has been termed the holy grail of diabetes treatments.

Oral insulin could fundamentally change the entire diabetes playing field since it would change the way insulin interacts with blood glucose and make the process more akin to what occurs in healthy people. Oramed is using similar technology to what Novo Nordisk is using in its own oral GLP-1 treatment, so there is reason to believe it could actually work.

Oral insulin could get prediabetics on insulin earlier since injecting insulin daily is not only inconvenient but almost taboo and a last resort. Getting prediabetics on insulin faster could go a long way in reducing late-stage complications as the disease progresses and insulin resistance sets in.

There is reason to believe insulin resistance – the factor that necessitates ever-higher doses of insulin and where most of the costs lay - will be less of a problem with an oral formulation because oral insulin goes through the liver, which is the natural organ for regulating insulin release once it receives it from the pancreas. It is a way of having the body naturally regulate insulin release rather than having to measure the dose via blood sugar analysis constantly.

All or any success amongst these three companies could take a significant bite out of overall diabetes costs over the next decade and beyond. Diabetes is by far the costliest health care niche and badly in need of a major advance. With three companies with potentially paradigm-shifting treatments in the pipe, chances are we will see that major advance before the close of this decade and before diabetes costs spiral completely out of control, if they have not done so already.",L,1.03

One Harvard study puts the annual cost at a much higher $822 billion annually. Whichever number you want to believe, it is among the costliest diseases in the world, for both patients and taxpayers. Thanks to Medicare and Medicaid, diabetes costs are socialized.



There are two reasons for the rising costs. First, the price of insulin has tripled since 2002. Second, the nature of lifetime treatment necessitates ever-rising doses of insulin as the disease progresses.

Short of hoping Americans radically change their diets overnight and drastically reduce sugar intake, the problem is not going away. But there is hope for significant cost reduction nonetheless. Here are three companies on the cutting edge of the newest diabetes advancements that, with some luck, may help reduce this nearly unfathomable cost to the U.S. economy and taxpayers.

Novo Nordisk and semaglutide

Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) recently announced its once-weekly GLP-1 agonist semaglutide handily beat Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide in terms of weight loss and blood sugar control in a pivotal Phase III trial. GLP-1 agonists, unlike insulin, stimulate pancreatic cells to produce insulin in a glucose-dependent manner. Meaning, GLP-1 agonists only induce native insulin production when blood glucose levels are high enough to trigger it. This is much more convenient than manually measuring blood sugar before injecting insulin directly.

While markets are focused on the one-on-one beat, raising Novo shares at the expense of Eli Lilly’s, there is potentially more exciting news regarding semaglutide yet to come. Novo Nordisk has already demonstrated in a Phase II trial that an oral formulation of semaglutide can work as well. If this continues into Phase III, the implication could be big for diabetes treatment costs. Oral formulations of otherwise intravenous drugs increase patient compliance and, if it works better than GLP-1 agonists currently on the market, it could keep diabetes patients healthier for longer, reducing long-run costs as the disease progresses, by far the costliest aspect of diabetes.

Roche and the artificial pancreas

Another innovative way to increase patient compliance and reduce long-run costs is to simply automate everything. Roche Holding AG (RHHBY) is currently sponsoring a late-stage development of an artificial pancreas that uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology together with an insulin pump to keep diabetics’ blood sugar in perpetual balance.

A pivotal Phase III trial was announced late last month, cosponsored by Roche Diabetics Care Inc. The ingenious closed-loop system uses a smartphone app to notify patients when blood sugar levels go out of range of preset limits. Since most of the damage from diabetes occurs when patients are out of their blood sugar target ranges, by keeping diabetics range-bound for longer, and hopefully perpetually, much of the cumulative damage from diabetes can hopefully be blunted or maybe even prevented for the long run. This closed-loop artificial pancreas is currently intended for Type 1 diabetics, though if successful it may be trialed for the much more prevalent Type 2 population.

Oramed and oral insulin

Perhaps the most ambitious of new diabetes treatments is an oral insulin formulation from Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ORMP). Oramed just recently announced a planned Phase III trial for what has been termed the holy grail of diabetes treatments.

Oral insulin could fundamentally change the entire diabetes playing field since it would change the way insulin interacts with blood glucose and make the process more akin to what occurs in healthy people. Oramed is using similar technology to what Novo Nordisk is using in its own oral GLP-1 treatment, so there is reason to believe it could actually work.

Oral insulin could get prediabetics on insulin earlier since injecting insulin daily is not only inconvenient but almost taboo and a last resort. Getting prediabetics on insulin faster could go a long way in reducing late-stage complications as the disease progresses and insulin resistance sets in.

There is reason to believe insulin resistance – the factor that necessitates ever-higher doses of insulin and where most of the costs lay - will be less of a problem with an oral formulation because oral insulin goes through the liver, which is the natural organ for regulating insulin release once it receives it from the pancreas. It is a way of having the body naturally regulate insulin release rather than having to measure the dose via blood sugar analysis constantly.

All or any success amongst these three companies could take a significant bite out of overall diabetes costs over the next decade and beyond. Diabetes is by far the costliest health care niche and badly in need of a major advance. With three companies with potentially paradigm-shifting treatments in the pipe, chances are we will see that major advance before the close of this decade and before diabetes costs spiral completely out of control, if they have not done so already.",L,1.05

2017-08-22,SHPG,,"Shire: At 52-Week Low, Long-Term Opportunity Appears Significant","Shire's share price has been languishing near 52-week lows for a little while now.

Despite valid concerns about the prospect of intense competition in its important hematology franchise, the business remains attractive.

New assets in ophthalmology and oncology are generating strong results already, and additional assets look set to continue the trend.

Baxalta deal is also going well, and the potential exit from neuroscience should consolidate its reputation as the rare disease specialist at a time when orphan drug growth is expected to grow rapidly.

Combined with a highly cash-generative and healthy business, Shire looks very attractive for long-term investors right now. Shire’s* (SHPG) share price recently hit a 52-week low in both its London- and NASDAQ-listed shares. Yet, I continue to struggle to precisely see why this should be the case. Its H1 2017 results showed a company which was doing well across its franchises except neuroscience in which continued destocking in the second quarter of the year pushed it into negative growth (Data source: Q2 2017 Results):  Yet, nothing immediately jumped out as being justification for continued weakness in its share price. After all, excluding the effects of destocking, even neuroscience had seen growth.

As we will see, however, Shire is certainly facing intense competition in some of its core areas. Yet, its success in fresh R&D results, combined with current and potential corporate level changes, suggests Shire is being undervalued right now. For long-term investors, today's somewhat subdued share price seems an ideal opportunity to buy into an increasingly compelling growth story coming from the world’s global leader in rare diseases.

A Hematology Hiatus Coming?

First off, we need to reflect a little on one of the main drivers of Shire’s share price weakness. Chiefly, this has surrounded increasing potential competition in some of its core franchises. This is especially true in its hematology franchise. Picked up as part of its Baxalta acquisition in 2016, it is now the largest revenue generator in the company. Yet, investors are getting a little nervous about potential threats in this area.

The subject has been more thoroughly explored by HealthBlogger last month. Shire has, however, a leading market position in the hematology market. Its ADVATE and ADYNOVATE are approved for use in the treatment of hemophilia without inhibitor (that is, for those patients who have not developed Factor VIII inhibitors). Indeed, ADVATE is the top Factor VIII brand with proven efficacy in the market. Similarly, for those who have developed Factor VIII inhibitors, Shire markets FEIBA which is an anti-inhibitor coagulant or bypassing agent. For Shire, this latter area contributes about 23% of total hematology revenue with the former contributing the lion’s share of the rest (Data source: Q2 2017 Results): However, competition is building. Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY) has seen its emicizumab (ACE910) drug perform well against its primary and all its secondary endpoints in its Phase III trial. As it explained:

The primary endpoint showed a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in treated bleeds of 87% (risk rate [RR]=0.13, p<0.0001) with emicizumab prophylaxis compared with on-demand (no prophylaxis; episodic use only) bypassing agents.
Although Shire and Roche are taking the battle of the treatments through the court, it is clear that should it reach the market (perhaps next year), it poses a sizeable threat to Feiba’s revenue. Shire’s CEO, Flemming Ornskov, argued that, despite reservations, ACE910 could result in hefty market share losses:

While we don't know for sure how much of our approximately $800 million in annual global sales of FEIBA is at risk, and this will most certainly be impacted by the potential approval timing, the final label and the future clinical and real-world data generated from patients, we do think that the market's current expectation for up to 50% share erosion after five years post-launch is reasonable. That said, we believe there will be no one-size-fits-all approach to treating these kinds of patients, and FEIBA will remain an important therapeutic option also in the future.
Roche is also in the process of releasing data on its Phase III trial pitching emicizumab into the hemophilia without inhibitors treatment. Naturally, should this readout be strong, this poses a threat to a far larger part of hematology revenue. Undoubtedly, as HealthBlogger highlighted:

The unmet need in this segment is much lower than in the inhibitor segment, because the factor VIII replacement therapy (i.e. ADVATE) is a high efficacious therapy for these patients, but if the drug will show a similar compelling profile also in this segment, it’s reasonable to assume that Shire will lose additional market share also in this therapeutic indication.
Roche is thus posing a looming and near-term threat to Shire’s strong position in the hematology market. Other competitors are also lining up to take a share of the spoils, however. BioMarin, for instance, has seen strong results from its Phase I/II trial of its BMN 270 gene therapy. Although it still needs to pass through the larger Phase III trial, some believe that BMN 270 could be on the market by 2019. This would undoubtedly put more pressure on Shire’s hematology revenue. With other pharma companies coming up with potential new drugs to take share from Shire’s already on-market drugs, investors are understandably a bit more aware of the potential frailty in its major revenue generator.

Nonetheless, Shire has not been standing still with its own pipeline in the hematology space. Its lanadelumab (SHP643) Phase III trial for heredity angioedema (NYSE:HAE) is showing early signs of strong promise in its primary and secondary endpoints. Shire may well be facing tougher competition in its core hemophilia market, yet its broader hematology franchise appears to be continuing its strong history of advances.

Lialda Laid Low?

Shire has also been facing a tough environment for its ulcerative colitis drug, LIALDA. The drug had become the star of its internal medicine franchise and contributed nearly 6% of total revenue in Q2 2017:

News that Zydus Cadila had been given approval by the FDA to release a generic of the drug, therefore, was hardly well received by investors. The arrival of the LIALDA generic was, as Shire’s CEO Flemming Ornskov noted, “a little earlier than [they] anticipated.”

As a result, this had driven down the revenue predictions for FY 2017 to between $14.3 billion and $14.6 billion (driven, as it explained, primarily by the generics arrival). Despite this, however, it remains the only generic on the market at present and as such Shire believes it can keep its market share fairly healthy. As Ornskov explained:

in a market with one generic competitor and, for the matter, even if there was a second, we think we can maintain a reasonable share of this market in the next few years.
Clearly, however, it will impact upon margins for the drug. What is more, it is hard to argue with Ornskov when he explained that “longer term, [maintaining market share] will become increasingly difficult.”

Although an unwelcome revenue shock, however, Shire remains well-placed in its internal medicine franchise. GATTEX, its drug for short bowel syndrome, saw its constant-currency revenue growth jump 70% in Q2 2017. With Shire directing its LIALDA sales teams to focus on GATTEX, we can expect to see continued strong growth in this drugs revenue contribution. Indeed, its performance should be strong enough to soften the blow coming from the revenue declines seen in the LIALDA business.

The threats to its hematological and LIALDA revenue are certainly something to watch, yet it is important to note that Shire has a great many opportunities facing it which investors have perhaps forgotten in the face of recent news flow.

Ophthalmology Opportunity

Ophthalmology is a new business area. It opened a unit back in May 2014 seeing an opportunity to do as it has done throughout its history: fill a research vacuum in rare and specialty diseases.

XIIDRA (picked up as part of their $160 million acquisition of SARcode in 2013) received approval in July 2016. It was the first drug to treat both the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. This gives it the edge on the established market drug, RESTASIS, already generated strong revenue for Allergan (AGN). XIIDRA also has another benefit over RESTASIS: it works faster.

Unsurprisingly, therefore, XIIDRA has already shown good revenue momentum. As Jeffrey Poulton, Shire’s CFO, noted:

We continue to be pleased with the performance of XIIDRA since launch. XIIDRA contributed $57 million in sales during the quarter, as prescription demand increased 13% from Q1, with market share increasing to approximately 23% by the end of Q2.
Indeed, it has already built up its market share rapidly since it was launched (Data source: Q1 2017 Results Presentation): Yet, here is the thing, this is a huge market share despite the fact that XIIDRA has not yet gained access to a large part of the DED market. As Poulton added at Q1 2017:

Importantly, this very impressive [market share] gain has been primarily driven by our ability to command share in the commercial insurance market, where XIIDRA has broad coverage. In the commercial market alone, our share is, of course, much higher than 22%. As you may know, we do not have broad Medicare coverage yet. I remain optimistic that we will be able to improve access to the Medicare population, who accounts for more than 40% of the current dry eye disease market.
Adding later that:

We’re building this [XIIDRA] brand into a blockbuster like we did with VYVANSE, step-by-step, keeping in mind we have patents until 2029 and expect few potential competitive entrants before XIIDRA’s patent expiry.
What is more, Shire has good pipeline prospects for building a more broad-based ophthalmology franchise. As well as additional DED developments, it has good trial progress in glaucoma and infectious conjunctivitis (Source: Shire Ophthalmology Pipeline in July 2017):",L,1.81

Evidence suggests the next RSV vaccine trial will not be a repetition of the 2016 failure, but will succeed in line with past Phase II trials.

I'm like the man from Texas. You see, the man from Missouri always says, 'You've got to show me.' But the man from Texas says, 'You've got to put it in my hand.'"" —Jack London
Novavax (NASDAQ: NVAX) is a clinical-stage biotech company with an enviable pipeline, including a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a disease that afflicts millions of people around the world. Novavax's maternal RSV vaccine candidate is in the Phase III clinical trial stage. Novavax's work toward a viable RSV vaccine won the backing of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2015, including up to $89 million in grants to support the development and clinical trials of a maternal vaccine.

Novavax's story goes well beyond just one vaccine, with other prospective drugs in the pipeline, including vaccines for the Zika virus and Ebola, as well as a novel nanoparticle flu vaccine that utilizes the company's proprietary Matrix-M adjuvant.

This would all seem to add up to an exceptional story. Unfortunately, there is a very serious hitch: In September 2016, the Phase III clinical trial of Novavax's RSV vaccine for elderly patients, dubbed “Resolve”, laid an egg. The trial failed to meet both its primary and secondary endpoints. The market reacted as one would expect, with Novavax's share price taking a more than 83 percent dive overnight. Since then, the stock has slipped further and now trades around $1.00 per share. That is a far cry from the $8.34 per share posted the day the Resolve trial results were announced.",L,8.0

My last report, published in February, provided a detailed analysis of the company's initial gene therapy product, ABO-102, which is in clinical trials for San Filippo Syndrome Type A. This company uses an identical AAV9 vector to that employed by AveXis (AVXS) for their SMA gene therapy product. Initial data from the first six patients is extremely encouraging demonstrating a dose response in biomarkers (such as urinary GAG and CSF GAG) and suggestive evidence that the patients are experiencing a neurocognitive benefit. In fact, the clinical trial data presented during the past six months on this product really couldn't have been any better. You can read about this product in my initial report and see the initial clinical trial data in the company presentation.

2017-08-22,CYTK,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/handwriting-on-the-wall-suggests-progress-in-als-may-be-imminent-says-cytokinetics-ceo," 'Writing on the wall' suggests progress in ALS may be imminent, says Cytokinetics CEO","San Franciscan firm Cytokinetics (Nasdaq: CYTK) is pursuing an unusual angle to therapeutic discovery, starting from an understanding of the biology of muscles in order to explore treatment options in different disease areas.

This approach has seen the company develop a diverse pipeline of candidates, in heart failure, in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where lead candidate tirasemtiv is due to read out at Phase III later this year.

Launched 20 years ago, chief executive Robert Blum was with the firm from the start, leading in R&D and ultimately taking the tiller a few years after they went public in 2004.

Commenting on the company’s philosophy, Mr Blum points to: ""A pipeline that builds on one another, in terms of economies in drug discovery and synergies in drug development activities.""

Amgen collaboration in heart failure

As an example, he cites the company’s long-standing collaboration with fellow Californian biotech Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN), which he says has enabled investment in longer shots such as tirasemtiv.

""[Omecamtiv mecarbil] could ultimately be our most valuable program, and that has afforded us some advantages.""

""That's how we can make the commitment, take the risk, on tirasemtiv. Because we have partnered in other programs, most importantly omecamtiv mecarbil, with Amgen.”

“That could ultimately be our most valuable program, and that has afforded us some advantages. This candidate addresses a very large unmet need - high-risk heart failure patients who are recently hospitalized and therefore at high risk of death or readmission.”

“Heart failure is the largest cardiovascular market that is not well served by existing therapies. It's the number one reason why people over the age of 65 are hospitalized and the single largest line item in the pharmacotherapy budget for Medicare.”

Through its collaborations, Cytokinetics has been able to raise primarily non-diutive capital of over $500 million.

The economic potential in one program feeds into the rest of the company’s portfolio.

Mr Blum says: “As the drug went into Phase III it triggered milestone payments that enabled us to co-invest with Amgen to buy up our royalty economics.”

“We then sold a piece of those to generate additional capital, that we could invest in tirasemtiv.”

“I think this is most possible when you can organically build a pipeline by being the leader in one slice of biology. That affords these kinds of opportunities.""

Astellas collaboration in ALS

As well as Amgen, Cytokinetics is partnered with Japan’s Astellas Pharma (TYO: 4503), this time to develop treatments in neuromuscular indications.

While traditional approaches to ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, have sought to combat the condition from the perspective of nerve decay, Cytokinetics is looking at the disease through the prism of muscle biology, “remaining agnostic as to why the nerves may be degenerating.”

Mr Blum says: “We do know that the muscles are ultimately where the action is in the disease. Patients who live with ALS suffer a ruthless decline of muscle function, and typically die within three to four years, of respiratory failure and pneumonia.""

Cytokinetics believes its compound will be able to increase muscle force, empower and delay the time to muscle weakness and fatigue.

Recognizing the high burden of the disease and the high level of unmet need In ALS, Mr Blum says: “We knew that that could provide a very meaningful new opportunity to address the disease in ways unlike any other.""

The deal with Astellas was synergistic, as both companies are operating in the same research space. Mr Blum saw an advantage to combining their programs, as the company is: “making a major commitment to muscle biology, and employing different approaches that we thought to be quite complementary to ours.""

Cytokinetics has sold to Astellas an option on tirasemtiv, which would provide rights to co-develop and co-commercialize the drug outside of North America and Europe, where the American firm retains exclusivity.

Mr Blum says data from a large Phase III trial into the candidate will be presented at the annual International Symposium on ALS/MND, in Boston, in December.

“This is designed to confirm and extend findings from our earlier studies.”

""If the data are positive, we as a company are ready for regulatory filings in the US and Europe by mid-2018 to support our commercial activities. We're intending to commercialize this drug candidate ourselves in North America and Europe.""

Positive regulatory environment for ALS

Of particular interest in this therapeutic area is the recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of Radicava (edaravone), the first new drug in ALS for over two decades.

""The handwriting on the wall suggests that the division of neurology is accelerating review and approval of certain drugs for high unmet need.”

Unusually, the positive decision was the result of the FDA calling on the drugmaker, Japan’s Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma (TYO: 4508), to file for marketing authorization.

Asked whether this suggests a more positive approach toward expediting therapies, including for ALS, Mr Blum says: ""Yes, I think it probably does. The handwriting on the wall suggests that the division of neurology is accelerating review and approval of certain drugs for high unmet need.”

""What was noteworthy about the approval was that the trials seemed to be conflicting in terms of efficacy. I think the FDA was compelled by the fact that the drug appears to be safe, and they approved the drug subject to post-marketing conditions.""

""It's an important advance for the field, to be sure, but I think it will be interesting to see how it will be commercialized, and what the uptake will be.""

Under the stewardship of new FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, the FDA appears to be taking a more proactive approach, including hiring more staff, to bring innovative therapies to patients expeditiously.

Asked about progress at the FDA, Mr Blum says: ""From what I can see, things are moving forward very constructively. I think there's an opportunity for patients, caregivers, regulatory authorities, industry sponsors and everybody to align more on innovation, and create opportunities for new medicines that are truly innovative, to move forward swiftly.""
""I think the changes at the FDA underscore their commitment to the original intent of biopharmaceutical innovation, and that's the most encouraging sign coming out of Washington.""",L,4.42

2017-08-21,BMY,https://www.mesotheliomahelp.org/2017/08/results-opdivo-trial-may-help-mesothelioma-oncologists-identify-patients-will-benefit-drug/,,"In April, MesotheliomaHelp reported on the findings of a phase I clinical trial showing that the five-year survival rate for some lung cancer patients treated with Opdivo (nivolumab), an immunotherapy treatment, was “much higher” than historical data. Now, researchers report that results from a phase III clinical trial may help oncologists determine those lung cancer patients, and possibly, mesothelioma patients, who will benefit from the immuno-oncology drug.

Opdivo, developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, works by blocking the PD-L1 protein and activating the immune system, leading it to attack and kill cancer cells. According to a June 21 press release from The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, a team of researchers led by David Carbone, MD, PhD, of The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer – Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute, found that although the trial did not improve progression-free survival when compared with chemotherapy in the overall population, those patients with a high expression of PD-L1 did benefit.

“The good news is that we discovered that a subset of patients who had both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status did experience a significant benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

Specifically, the researchers report that patients who had “both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status” realized a 75 percent response rate compared to just 16 percent response rate with low mutation burden and low PDL-1. However, the response rates for chemotherapy treatment in these same subsets were nearly the same leading the researchers to conclude that the PDL-1 markers “were selective for immunotherapy.”

Mesothelioma, a rare, asbestos-related cancer of the lining of the lungs, abdomen or heart, is highly aggressive and is resistant to many cancer treatments. The prognosis for mesothelioma patients is usually grim: the average survival time varies from 4 – 18 months after diagnosis. For the close to 3,000 Americans diagnosed with the disease each year, personalized care may bring a breakthrough treatment not previously considered by their physician.

The benefits of personalized care for mesothelioma patients have been proven where researchers have identified genetic biomarkers that reflect the aggressiveness of mesothelioma as well as markers that can assess the effectiveness of a particular treatment.

Opdivo is currently in a phase III clinical trial in the UK for mesothelioma patients. Known as The CheckpOiNt Blockade For Inhibition of Relapsed Mesothelioma, or CONIFRM, the trial has a goal of ‘exploiting the potential of immunotherapy.’

Keytruda, which gained popularity after saving former President Jimmy Carter’s life after sending his melanoma into remission, is also a PD-L1 inhibitor. Both immunotherapy drugs have shown in studies to be effective in fighting pleural mesothelioma. Keytruda is, perhaps, more well known due to eight-year mesothelioma survivor Mavis Nye of England, who went into remission after a two-year clinical trial of the drug.

“This study is an important step toward understanding the impact of tumor mutation burden and PDL-1 in immunotherapy response. This data shows we should evaluate these two factors independently to most accurately define who will benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

About Recro Pharma, Inc.

Recro is a specialty pharmaceutical company that operates through two business divisions, an Acute Care, hospital product division and a revenue-generating contract development and manufacturing, or CDMO division, located at the Company's Gainesville facility. The Acute Care division is primarily focused on developing innovative products for hospital and other acute care settings. The Company's lead product candidate is a proprietary injectable form of meloxicam, a long-acting preferential COX-2 inhibitor. IV meloxicam 30mg has successfully completed two pivotal Phase III clinical efficacy trials in patients following bunionectomy and abdominoplasty surgeries, a large double blind Phase III safety trial, four Phase II clinical trials for the management of moderate to severe post-operative pain, as well as other safety studies. As injectable meloxicam is in the non-opioid class of drugs, the Company believes it will overcome many of the issues associated with commonly prescribed opioid therapeutics, including respiratory depression, constipation, excessive nausea and vomiting, as well as having no addictive potential while maintaining meaningful analgesic effects for relief of pain. The Company's CDMO division leverages its formulation expertise to develop and manufacture pharmaceutical products using its proprietary delivery technologies and other manufacturing services for commercial partners who commercialize or plan to commercialize these products. These collaborations can result in revenue streams including royalties, profit sharing, research and development and manufacturing fees, which support continued operations for its CDMO division and it contributes non-dilutive funding for the development and pre-commercialization activities of its Acute Care division.

2017-08-21,IRWD,https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Ironwood+Pharma+%28IRWD%29+Announces+FDA+Approval+of+DUZALLO+for+Treatment+of+Hyperuricemia+in+Patients+with+Uncontrolled+Gout/13222622.html,,"Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IRWD) today announced DUZALLO was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a once-daily oral treatment for hyperuricemia associated with gout in patients who have not achieved target serum uric acid (sUA) levels with a medically appropriate daily dose of allopurinol alone. DUZALLO is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Ironwood expects DUZALLO to be commercially available early in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Gout is a highly symptomatic and painful form of inflammatory arthritis caused by hyperuricemia, or elevated sUA levels in the blood, which can lead to painful flares and serious potential long-term health consequences.DUZALLO is the first drug that combines the current standard of care for the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout, allopurinol, with the most recent FDA-approved treatment for this condition, lesinurad. This fixed-dose combination provides a dual mechanism of action in a single tablet that can address both underlying causes of hyperuricemia – overproduction and underexcretion of serum uric acid.

“The approval of DUZALLO provides a new fixed-dose and dual-mechanism treatment option to help patients with uncontrolled gout achieve target serum uric acid levels. This represents an important and needed new option in the treatment of hyperuricemia,” said Michael A. Becker, M.D., professor emeritus of medicine, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL. “Gout is a serious and potentially progressive and debilitating inflammatory disease. Getting patients with gout to serum urate goal, and keeping them at or below goal, are essential to success in treating these patients. DUZALLO will help reduce the significant unmet need among patients in the U.S. who fail to get their serum uric acid levels to goal despite taking allopurinol alone.”

“With DUZALLO, nearly twice as many patients with uncontrolled gout may be able to achieve target serum uric acid levels compared to those patients taking allopurinol alone, which is important, considering the significant unmet need among uncontrolled gout patients to get to goal of under 6 mg/dL,” said Tom McCourt, senior vice president of marketing and sales and chief commercial officer at Ironwood. “We believe DUZALLO will be the critical driver behind Ironwood’s gout franchise, which is expected to exceed total annual U.S. peak sales of $300 million.”",L,2.65
2017-08-21,NVO,https://www.gurufocus.com/news/556495/3-companies-aiming-to-significantly-reduce-diabetes-treatment-costs,,"Total U.S. health care spending in 2015 was an astronomical $3.2 trillion. That is 16% of the entire national debt. As much as we blame the prices of new drugs for this gargantuan sum, one of the biggest chunks of it comes from diabetes, a disease whose treatment has not changed all that much since 1922. According to the American Diabetes Association, diabetes accounts for $322 billion in total U.S. health care spending as of 2016.

One Harvard study puts the annual cost at a much higher $822 billion annually. Whichever number you want to believe, it is among the costliest diseases in the world, for both patients and taxpayers. Thanks to Medicare and Medicaid, diabetes costs are socialized.



There are two reasons for the rising costs. First, the price of insulin has tripled since 2002. Second, the nature of lifetime treatment necessitates ever-rising doses of insulin as the disease progresses.

Short of hoping Americans radically change their diets overnight and drastically reduce sugar intake, the problem is not going away. But there is hope for significant cost reduction nonetheless. Here are three companies on the cutting edge of the newest diabetes advancements that, with some luck, may help reduce this nearly unfathomable cost to the U.S. economy and taxpayers.

Novo Nordisk and semaglutide

Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) recently announced its once-weekly GLP-1 agonist semaglutide handily beat Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide in terms of weight loss and blood sugar control in a pivotal Phase III trial. GLP-1 agonists, unlike insulin, stimulate pancreatic cells to produce insulin in a glucose-dependent manner. Meaning, GLP-1 agonists only induce native insulin production when blood glucose levels are high enough to trigger it. This is much more convenient than manually measuring blood sugar before injecting insulin directly.

While markets are focused on the one-on-one beat, raising Novo shares at the expense of Eli Lilly’s, there is potentially more exciting news regarding semaglutide yet to come. Novo Nordisk has already demonstrated in a Phase II trial that an oral formulation of semaglutide can work as well. If this continues into Phase III, the implication could be big for diabetes treatment costs. Oral formulations of otherwise intravenous drugs increase patient compliance and, if it works better than GLP-1 agonists currently on the market, it could keep diabetes patients healthier for longer, reducing long-run costs as the disease progresses, by far the costliest aspect of diabetes.

Roche and the artificial pancreas

Another innovative way to increase patient compliance and reduce long-run costs is to simply automate everything. Roche Holding AG (RHHBY) is currently sponsoring a late-stage development of an artificial pancreas that uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology together with an insulin pump to keep diabetics’ blood sugar in perpetual balance.

A pivotal Phase III trial was announced late last month, cosponsored by Roche Diabetics Care Inc. The ingenious closed-loop system uses a smartphone app to notify patients when blood sugar levels go out of range of preset limits. Since most of the damage from diabetes occurs when patients are out of their blood sugar target ranges, by keeping diabetics range-bound for longer, and hopefully perpetually, much of the cumulative damage from diabetes can hopefully be blunted or maybe even prevented for the long run. This closed-loop artificial pancreas is currently intended for Type 1 diabetics, though if successful it may be trialed for the much more prevalent Type 2 population.

Oramed and oral insulin

Perhaps the most ambitious of new diabetes treatments is an oral insulin formulation from Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ORMP). Oramed just recently announced a planned Phase III trial for what has been termed the holy grail of diabetes treatments.

Oral insulin could fundamentally change the entire diabetes playing field since it would change the way insulin interacts with blood glucose and make the process more akin to what occurs in healthy people. Oramed is using similar technology to what Novo Nordisk is using in its own oral GLP-1 treatment, so there is reason to believe it could actually work.

Oral insulin could get prediabetics on insulin earlier since injecting insulin daily is not only inconvenient but almost taboo and a last resort. Getting prediabetics on insulin faster could go a long way in reducing late-stage complications as the disease progresses and insulin resistance sets in.

There is reason to believe insulin resistance – the factor that necessitates ever-higher doses of insulin and where most of the costs lay - will be less of a problem with an oral formulation because oral insulin goes through the liver, which is the natural organ for regulating insulin release once it receives it from the pancreas. It is a way of having the body naturally regulate insulin release rather than having to measure the dose via blood sugar analysis constantly.

All or any success amongst these three companies could take a significant bite out of overall diabetes costs over the next decade and beyond. Diabetes is by far the costliest health care niche and badly in need of a major advance. With three companies with potentially paradigm-shifting treatments in the pipe, chances are we will see that major advance before the close of this decade and before diabetes costs spiral completely out of control, if they have not done so already.",L,1.03

2017-08-22,SHPG,,"Shire: At 52-Week Low, Long-Term Opportunity Appears Significant","Shire's share price has been languishing near 52-week lows for a little while now.

Despite valid concerns about the prospect of intense competition in its important hematology franchise, the business remains attractive.

New assets in ophthalmology and oncology are generating strong results already, and additional assets look set to continue the trend.

Baxalta deal is also going well, and the potential exit from neuroscience should consolidate its reputation as the rare disease specialist at a time when orphan drug growth is expected to grow rapidly.

Combined with a highly cash-generative and healthy business, Shire looks very attractive for long-term investors right now. Shire’s* (SHPG) share price recently hit a 52-week low in both its London- and NASDAQ-listed shares. Yet, I continue to struggle to precisely see why this should be the case. Its H1 2017 results showed a company which was doing well across its franchises except neuroscience in which continued destocking in the second quarter of the year pushed it into negative growth (Data source: Q2 2017 Results):  Yet, nothing immediately jumped out as being justification for continued weakness in its share price. After all, excluding the effects of destocking, even neuroscience had seen growth.

As we will see, however, Shire is certainly facing intense competition in some of its core areas. Yet, its success in fresh R&D results, combined with current and potential corporate level changes, suggests Shire is being undervalued right now. For long-term investors, today's somewhat subdued share price seems an ideal opportunity to buy into an increasingly compelling growth story coming from the world’s global leader in rare diseases.

A Hematology Hiatus Coming?

First off, we need to reflect a little on one of the main drivers of Shire’s share price weakness. Chiefly, this has surrounded increasing potential competition in some of its core franchises. This is especially true in its hematology franchise. Picked up as part of its Baxalta acquisition in 2016, it is now the largest revenue generator in the company. Yet, investors are getting a little nervous about potential threats in this area.

The subject has been more thoroughly explored by HealthBlogger last month. Shire has, however, a leading market position in the hematology market. Its ADVATE and ADYNOVATE are approved for use in the treatment of hemophilia without inhibitor (that is, for those patients who have not developed Factor VIII inhibitors). Indeed, ADVATE is the top Factor VIII brand with proven efficacy in the market. Similarly, for those who have developed Factor VIII inhibitors, Shire markets FEIBA which is an anti-inhibitor coagulant or bypassing agent. For Shire, this latter area contributes about 23% of total hematology revenue with the former contributing the lion’s share of the rest (Data source: Q2 2017 Results): However, competition is building. Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY) has seen its emicizumab (ACE910) drug perform well against its primary and all its secondary endpoints in its Phase III trial. As it explained:

The primary endpoint showed a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in treated bleeds of 87% (risk rate [RR]=0.13, p<0.0001) with emicizumab prophylaxis compared with on-demand (no prophylaxis; episodic use only) bypassing agents.
Although Shire and Roche are taking the battle of the treatments through the court, it is clear that should it reach the market (perhaps next year), it poses a sizeable threat to Feiba’s revenue. Shire’s CEO, Flemming Ornskov, argued that, despite reservations, ACE910 could result in hefty market share losses:

While we don't know for sure how much of our approximately $800 million in annual global sales of FEIBA is at risk, and this will most certainly be impacted by the potential approval timing, the final label and the future clinical and real-world data generated from patients, we do think that the market's current expectation for up to 50% share erosion after five years post-launch is reasonable. That said, we believe there will be no one-size-fits-all approach to treating these kinds of patients, and FEIBA will remain an important therapeutic option also in the future.
Roche is also in the process of releasing data on its Phase III trial pitching emicizumab into the hemophilia without inhibitors treatment. Naturally, should this readout be strong, this poses a threat to a far larger part of hematology revenue. Undoubtedly, as HealthBlogger highlighted:

The unmet need in this segment is much lower than in the inhibitor segment, because the factor VIII replacement therapy (i.e. ADVATE) is a high efficacious therapy for these patients, but if the drug will show a similar compelling profile also in this segment, it’s reasonable to assume that Shire will lose additional market share also in this therapeutic indication.
Roche is thus posing a looming and near-term threat to Shire’s strong position in the hematology market. Other competitors are also lining up to take a share of the spoils, however. BioMarin, for instance, has seen strong results from its Phase I/II trial of its BMN 270 gene therapy. Although it still needs to pass through the larger Phase III trial, some believe that BMN 270 could be on the market by 2019. This would undoubtedly put more pressure on Shire’s hematology revenue. With other pharma companies coming up with potential new drugs to take share from Shire’s already on-market drugs, investors are understandably a bit more aware of the potential frailty in its major revenue generator.

Nonetheless, Shire has not been standing still with its own pipeline in the hematology space. Its lanadelumab (SHP643) Phase III trial for heredity angioedema (NYSE:HAE) is showing early signs of strong promise in its primary and secondary endpoints. Shire may well be facing tougher competition in its core hemophilia market, yet its broader hematology franchise appears to be continuing its strong history of advances.

Lialda Laid Low?

Shire has also been facing a tough environment for its ulcerative colitis drug, LIALDA. The drug had become the star of its internal medicine franchise and contributed nearly 6% of total revenue in Q2 2017:

News that Zydus Cadila had been given approval by the FDA to release a generic of the drug, therefore, was hardly well received by investors. The arrival of the LIALDA generic was, as Shire’s CEO Flemming Ornskov noted, “a little earlier than [they] anticipated.”

As a result, this had driven down the revenue predictions for FY 2017 to between $14.3 billion and $14.6 billion (driven, as it explained, primarily by the generics arrival). Despite this, however, it remains the only generic on the market at present and as such Shire believes it can keep its market share fairly healthy. As Ornskov explained:

in a market with one generic competitor and, for the matter, even if there was a second, we think we can maintain a reasonable share of this market in the next few years.
Clearly, however, it will impact upon margins for the drug. What is more, it is hard to argue with Ornskov when he explained that “longer term, [maintaining market share] will become increasingly difficult.”

Although an unwelcome revenue shock, however, Shire remains well-placed in its internal medicine franchise. GATTEX, its drug for short bowel syndrome, saw its constant-currency revenue growth jump 70% in Q2 2017. With Shire directing its LIALDA sales teams to focus on GATTEX, we can expect to see continued strong growth in this drugs revenue contribution. Indeed, its performance should be strong enough to soften the blow coming from the revenue declines seen in the LIALDA business.

The threats to its hematological and LIALDA revenue are certainly something to watch, yet it is important to note that Shire has a great many opportunities facing it which investors have perhaps forgotten in the face of recent news flow.

Ophthalmology Opportunity

Ophthalmology is a new business area. It opened a unit back in May 2014 seeing an opportunity to do as it has done throughout its history: fill a research vacuum in rare and specialty diseases.

XIIDRA (picked up as part of their $160 million acquisition of SARcode in 2013) received approval in July 2016. It was the first drug to treat both the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. This gives it the edge on the established market drug, RESTASIS, already generated strong revenue for Allergan (AGN). XIIDRA also has another benefit over RESTASIS: it works faster.

Unsurprisingly, therefore, XIIDRA has already shown good revenue momentum. As Jeffrey Poulton, Shire’s CFO, noted:

We continue to be pleased with the performance of XIIDRA since launch. XIIDRA contributed $57 million in sales during the quarter, as prescription demand increased 13% from Q1, with market share increasing to approximately 23% by the end of Q2.
Indeed, it has already built up its market share rapidly since it was launched (Data source: Q1 2017 Results Presentation): Yet, here is the thing, this is a huge market share despite the fact that XIIDRA has not yet gained access to a large part of the DED market. As Poulton added at Q1 2017:

Importantly, this very impressive [market share] gain has been primarily driven by our ability to command share in the commercial insurance market, where XIIDRA has broad coverage. In the commercial market alone, our share is, of course, much higher than 22%. As you may know, we do not have broad Medicare coverage yet. I remain optimistic that we will be able to improve access to the Medicare population, who accounts for more than 40% of the current dry eye disease market.
Adding later that:

We’re building this [XIIDRA] brand into a blockbuster like we did with VYVANSE, step-by-step, keeping in mind we have patents until 2029 and expect few potential competitive entrants before XIIDRA’s patent expiry.
What is more, Shire has good pipeline prospects for building a more broad-based ophthalmology franchise. As well as additional DED developments, it has good trial progress in glaucoma and infectious conjunctivitis (Source: Shire Ophthalmology Pipeline in July 2017):",L,1.81

I'm like the man from Texas. You see, the man from Missouri always says, 'You've got to show me.' But the man from Texas says, 'You've got to put it in my hand.'"" —Jack London
Novavax (NASDAQ: NVAX) is a clinical-stage biotech company with an enviable pipeline, including a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a disease that afflicts millions of people around the world. Novavax's maternal RSV vaccine candidate is in the Phase III clinical trial stage. Novavax's work toward a viable RSV vaccine won the backing of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2015, including up to $89 million in grants to support the development and clinical trials of a maternal vaccine.

Novavax's story goes well beyond just one vaccine, with other prospective drugs in the pipeline, including vaccines for the Zika virus and Ebola, as well as a novel nanoparticle flu vaccine that utilizes the company's proprietary Matrix-M adjuvant.

This would all seem to add up to an exceptional story. Unfortunately, there is a very serious hitch: In September 2016, the Phase III clinical trial of Novavax's RSV vaccine for elderly patients, dubbed “Resolve”, laid an egg. The trial failed to meet both its primary and secondary endpoints. The market reacted as one would expect, with Novavax's share price taking a more than 83 percent dive overnight. Since then, the stock has slipped further and now trades around $1.00 per share. That is a far cry from the $8.34 per share posted the day the Resolve trial results were announced.",L,8.0

This approach has seen the company develop a diverse pipeline of candidates, in heart failure, in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where lead candidate tirasemtiv is due to read out at Phase III later this year.

Launched 20 years ago, chief executive Robert Blum was with the firm from the start, leading in R&D and ultimately taking the tiller a few years after they went public in 2004.

Commenting on the company’s philosophy, Mr Blum points to: ""A pipeline that builds on one another, in terms of economies in drug discovery and synergies in drug development activities.""

Amgen collaboration in heart failure

As an example, he cites the company’s long-standing collaboration with fellow Californian biotech Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN), which he says has enabled investment in longer shots such as tirasemtiv.

""[Omecamtiv mecarbil] could ultimately be our most valuable program, and that has afforded us some advantages.""

""That's how we can make the commitment, take the risk, on tirasemtiv. Because we have partnered in other programs, most importantly omecamtiv mecarbil, with Amgen.”

“That could ultimately be our most valuable program, and that has afforded us some advantages. This candidate addresses a very large unmet need - high-risk heart failure patients who are recently hospitalized and therefore at high risk of death or readmission.”

“Heart failure is the largest cardiovascular market that is not well served by existing therapies. It's the number one reason why people over the age of 65 are hospitalized and the single largest line item in the pharmacotherapy budget for Medicare.”

Through its collaborations, Cytokinetics has been able to raise primarily non-diutive capital of over $500 million.

The economic potential in one program feeds into the rest of the company’s portfolio.

Mr Blum says: “As the drug went into Phase III it triggered milestone payments that enabled us to co-invest with Amgen to buy up our royalty economics.”

“We then sold a piece of those to generate additional capital, that we could invest in tirasemtiv.”

“I think this is most possible when you can organically build a pipeline by being the leader in one slice of biology. That affords these kinds of opportunities.""

Astellas collaboration in ALS

As well as Amgen, Cytokinetics is partnered with Japan’s Astellas Pharma (TYO: 4503), this time to develop treatments in neuromuscular indications.

While traditional approaches to ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, have sought to combat the condition from the perspective of nerve decay, Cytokinetics is looking at the disease through the prism of muscle biology, “remaining agnostic as to why the nerves may be degenerating.”

Mr Blum says: “We do know that the muscles are ultimately where the action is in the disease. Patients who live with ALS suffer a ruthless decline of muscle function, and typically die within three to four years, of respiratory failure and pneumonia.""

Cytokinetics believes its compound will be able to increase muscle force, empower and delay the time to muscle weakness and fatigue.

Recognizing the high burden of the disease and the high level of unmet need In ALS, Mr Blum says: “We knew that that could provide a very meaningful new opportunity to address the disease in ways unlike any other.""

The deal with Astellas was synergistic, as both companies are operating in the same research space. Mr Blum saw an advantage to combining their programs, as the company is: “making a major commitment to muscle biology, and employing different approaches that we thought to be quite complementary to ours.""

Cytokinetics has sold to Astellas an option on tirasemtiv, which would provide rights to co-develop and co-commercialize the drug outside of North America and Europe, where the American firm retains exclusivity.

Mr Blum says data from a large Phase III trial into the candidate will be presented at the annual International Symposium on ALS/MND, in Boston, in December.

“This is designed to confirm and extend findings from our earlier studies.”

""If the data are positive, we as a company are ready for regulatory filings in the US and Europe by mid-2018 to support our commercial activities. We're intending to commercialize this drug candidate ourselves in North America and Europe.""

Positive regulatory environment for ALS

Of particular interest in this therapeutic area is the recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of Radicava (edaravone), the first new drug in ALS for over two decades.

""The handwriting on the wall suggests that the division of neurology is accelerating review and approval of certain drugs for high unmet need.”

Unusually, the positive decision was the result of the FDA calling on the drugmaker, Japan’s Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma (TYO: 4508), to file for marketing authorization.

Asked whether this suggests a more positive approach toward expediting therapies, including for ALS, Mr Blum says: ""Yes, I think it probably does. The handwriting on the wall suggests that the division of neurology is accelerating review and approval of certain drugs for high unmet need.”

""What was noteworthy about the approval was that the trials seemed to be conflicting in terms of efficacy. I think the FDA was compelled by the fact that the drug appears to be safe, and they approved the drug subject to post-marketing conditions.""

""It's an important advance for the field, to be sure, but I think it will be interesting to see how it will be commercialized, and what the uptake will be.""

Under the stewardship of new FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, the FDA appears to be taking a more proactive approach, including hiring more staff, to bring innovative therapies to patients expeditiously.

Asked about progress at the FDA, Mr Blum says: ""From what I can see, things are moving forward very constructively. I think there's an opportunity for patients, caregivers, regulatory authorities, industry sponsors and everybody to align more on innovation, and create opportunities for new medicines that are truly innovative, to move forward swiftly.""
""I think the changes at the FDA underscore their commitment to the original intent of biopharmaceutical innovation, and that's the most encouraging sign coming out of Washington.""",L,4.42

2017-08-21,BMY,https://www.mesotheliomahelp.org/2017/08/results-opdivo-trial-may-help-mesothelioma-oncologists-identify-patients-will-benefit-drug/,,"In April, MesotheliomaHelp reported on the findings of a phase I clinical trial showing that the five-year survival rate for some lung cancer patients treated with Opdivo (nivolumab), an immunotherapy treatment, was “much higher” than historical data. Now, researchers report that results from a phase III clinical trial may help oncologists determine those lung cancer patients, and possibly, mesothelioma patients, who will benefit from the immuno-oncology drug.

Opdivo, developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, works by blocking the PD-L1 protein and activating the immune system, leading it to attack and kill cancer cells. According to a June 21 press release from The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, a team of researchers led by David Carbone, MD, PhD, of The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer – Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute, found that although the trial did not improve progression-free survival when compared with chemotherapy in the overall population, those patients with a high expression of PD-L1 did benefit.

“The good news is that we discovered that a subset of patients who had both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status did experience a significant benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

Specifically, the researchers report that patients who had “both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status” realized a 75 percent response rate compared to just 16 percent response rate with low mutation burden and low PDL-1. However, the response rates for chemotherapy treatment in these same subsets were nearly the same leading the researchers to conclude that the PDL-1 markers “were selective for immunotherapy.”

Mesothelioma, a rare, asbestos-related cancer of the lining of the lungs, abdomen or heart, is highly aggressive and is resistant to many cancer treatments. The prognosis for mesothelioma patients is usually grim: the average survival time varies from 4 – 18 months after diagnosis. For the close to 3,000 Americans diagnosed with the disease each year, personalized care may bring a breakthrough treatment not previously considered by their physician.

The benefits of personalized care for mesothelioma patients have been proven where researchers have identified genetic biomarkers that reflect the aggressiveness of mesothelioma as well as markers that can assess the effectiveness of a particular treatment.

Opdivo is currently in a phase III clinical trial in the UK for mesothelioma patients. Known as The CheckpOiNt Blockade For Inhibition of Relapsed Mesothelioma, or CONIFRM, the trial has a goal of ‘exploiting the potential of immunotherapy.’

Keytruda, which gained popularity after saving former President Jimmy Carter’s life after sending his melanoma into remission, is also a PD-L1 inhibitor. Both immunotherapy drugs have shown in studies to be effective in fighting pleural mesothelioma. Keytruda is, perhaps, more well known due to eight-year mesothelioma survivor Mavis Nye of England, who went into remission after a two-year clinical trial of the drug.

“This study is an important step toward understanding the impact of tumor mutation burden and PDL-1 in immunotherapy response. This data shows we should evaluate these two factors independently to most accurately define who will benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

About Recro Pharma, Inc.

Recro is a specialty pharmaceutical company that operates through two business divisions, an Acute Care, hospital product division and a revenue-generating contract development and manufacturing, or CDMO division, located at the Company's Gainesville facility. The Acute Care division is primarily focused on developing innovative products for hospital and other acute care settings. The Company's lead product candidate is a proprietary injectable form of meloxicam, a long-acting preferential COX-2 inhibitor. IV meloxicam 30mg has successfully completed two pivotal Phase III clinical efficacy trials in patients following bunionectomy and abdominoplasty surgeries, a large double blind Phase III safety trial, four Phase II clinical trials for the management of moderate to severe post-operative pain, as well as other safety studies. As injectable meloxicam is in the non-opioid class of drugs, the Company believes it will overcome many of the issues associated with commonly prescribed opioid therapeutics, including respiratory depression, constipation, excessive nausea and vomiting, as well as having no addictive potential while maintaining meaningful analgesic effects for relief of pain. The Company's CDMO division leverages its formulation expertise to develop and manufacture pharmaceutical products using its proprietary delivery technologies and other manufacturing services for commercial partners who commercialize or plan to commercialize these products. These collaborations can result in revenue streams including royalties, profit sharing, research and development and manufacturing fees, which support continued operations for its CDMO division and it contributes non-dilutive funding for the development and pre-commercialization activities of its Acute Care division.

2017-08-21,IRWD,https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Ironwood+Pharma+%28IRWD%29+Announces+FDA+Approval+of+DUZALLO+for+Treatment+of+Hyperuricemia+in+Patients+with+Uncontrolled+Gout/13222622.html,,"Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IRWD) today announced DUZALLO was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a once-daily oral treatment for hyperuricemia associated with gout in patients who have not achieved target serum uric acid (sUA) levels with a medically appropriate daily dose of allopurinol alone. DUZALLO is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Ironwood expects DUZALLO to be commercially available early in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Gout is a highly symptomatic and painful form of inflammatory arthritis caused by hyperuricemia, or elevated sUA levels in the blood, which can lead to painful flares and serious potential long-term health consequences.DUZALLO is the first drug that combines the current standard of care for the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout, allopurinol, with the most recent FDA-approved treatment for this condition, lesinurad. This fixed-dose combination provides a dual mechanism of action in a single tablet that can address both underlying causes of hyperuricemia – overproduction and underexcretion of serum uric acid.

“The approval of DUZALLO provides a new fixed-dose and dual-mechanism treatment option to help patients with uncontrolled gout achieve target serum uric acid levels. This represents an important and needed new option in the treatment of hyperuricemia,” said Michael A. Becker, M.D., professor emeritus of medicine, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL. “Gout is a serious and potentially progressive and debilitating inflammatory disease. Getting patients with gout to serum urate goal, and keeping them at or below goal, are essential to success in treating these patients. DUZALLO will help reduce the significant unmet need among patients in the U.S. who fail to get their serum uric acid levels to goal despite taking allopurinol alone.”

“With DUZALLO, nearly twice as many patients with uncontrolled gout may be able to achieve target serum uric acid levels compared to those patients taking allopurinol alone, which is important, considering the significant unmet need among uncontrolled gout patients to get to goal of under 6 mg/dL,” said Tom McCourt, senior vice president of marketing and sales and chief commercial officer at Ironwood. “We believe DUZALLO will be the critical driver behind Ironwood’s gout franchise, which is expected to exceed total annual U.S. peak sales of $300 million.”",L,2.65
2017-08-21,NVO,https://www.gurufocus.com/news/556495/3-companies-aiming-to-significantly-reduce-diabetes-treatment-costs,,"Total U.S. health care spending in 2015 was an astronomical $3.2 trillion. That is 16% of the entire national debt. As much as we blame the prices of new drugs for this gargantuan sum, one of the biggest chunks of it comes from diabetes, a disease whose treatment has not changed all that much since 1922. According to the American Diabetes Association, diabetes accounts for $322 billion in total U.S. health care spending as of 2016.

One Harvard study puts the annual cost at a much higher $822 billion annually. Whichever number you want to believe, it is among the costliest diseases in the world, for both patients and taxpayers. Thanks to Medicare and Medicaid, diabetes costs are socialized.



There are two reasons for the rising costs. First, the price of insulin has tripled since 2002. Second, the nature of lifetime treatment necessitates ever-rising doses of insulin as the disease progresses.

Short of hoping Americans radically change their diets overnight and drastically reduce sugar intake, the problem is not going away. But there is hope for significant cost reduction nonetheless. Here are three companies on the cutting edge of the newest diabetes advancements that, with some luck, may help reduce this nearly unfathomable cost to the U.S. economy and taxpayers.

Novo Nordisk and semaglutide

Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) recently announced its once-weekly GLP-1 agonist semaglutide handily beat Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide in terms of weight loss and blood sugar control in a pivotal Phase III trial. GLP-1 agonists, unlike insulin, stimulate pancreatic cells to produce insulin in a glucose-dependent manner. Meaning, GLP-1 agonists only induce native insulin production when blood glucose levels are high enough to trigger it. This is much more convenient than manually measuring blood sugar before injecting insulin directly.

While markets are focused on the one-on-one beat, raising Novo shares at the expense of Eli Lilly’s, there is potentially more exciting news regarding semaglutide yet to come. Novo Nordisk has already demonstrated in a Phase II trial that an oral formulation of semaglutide can work as well. If this continues into Phase III, the implication could be big for diabetes treatment costs. Oral formulations of otherwise intravenous drugs increase patient compliance and, if it works better than GLP-1 agonists currently on the market, it could keep diabetes patients healthier for longer, reducing long-run costs as the disease progresses, by far the costliest aspect of diabetes.

Roche and the artificial pancreas

Another innovative way to increase patient compliance and reduce long-run costs is to simply automate everything. Roche Holding AG (RHHBY) is currently sponsoring a late-stage development of an artificial pancreas that uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology together with an insulin pump to keep diabetics’ blood sugar in perpetual balance.

A pivotal Phase III trial was announced late last month, cosponsored by Roche Diabetics Care Inc. The ingenious closed-loop system uses a smartphone app to notify patients when blood sugar levels go out of range of preset limits. Since most of the damage from diabetes occurs when patients are out of their blood sugar target ranges, by keeping diabetics range-bound for longer, and hopefully perpetually, much of the cumulative damage from diabetes can hopefully be blunted or maybe even prevented for the long run. This closed-loop artificial pancreas is currently intended for Type 1 diabetics, though if successful it may be trialed for the much more prevalent Type 2 population.

Oramed and oral insulin

Perhaps the most ambitious of new diabetes treatments is an oral insulin formulation from Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ORMP). Oramed just recently announced a planned Phase III trial for what has been termed the holy grail of diabetes treatments.

Oral insulin could fundamentally change the entire diabetes playing field since it would change the way insulin interacts with blood glucose and make the process more akin to what occurs in healthy people. Oramed is using similar technology to what Novo Nordisk is using in its own oral GLP-1 treatment, so there is reason to believe it could actually work.

Oral insulin could get prediabetics on insulin earlier since injecting insulin daily is not only inconvenient but almost taboo and a last resort. Getting prediabetics on insulin faster could go a long way in reducing late-stage complications as the disease progresses and insulin resistance sets in.

There is reason to believe insulin resistance – the factor that necessitates ever-higher doses of insulin and where most of the costs lay - will be less of a problem with an oral formulation because oral insulin goes through the liver, which is the natural organ for regulating insulin release once it receives it from the pancreas. It is a way of having the body naturally regulate insulin release rather than having to measure the dose via blood sugar analysis constantly.

All or any success amongst these three companies could take a significant bite out of overall diabetes costs over the next decade and beyond. Diabetes is by far the costliest health care niche and badly in need of a major advance. With three companies with potentially paradigm-shifting treatments in the pipe, chances are we will see that major advance before the close of this decade and before diabetes costs spiral completely out of control, if they have not done so already.",L,1.03

Oramed and oral insulin

Perhaps the most ambitious of new diabetes treatments is an oral insulin formulation from Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ORMP). Oramed just recently announced a planned Phase III trial for what has been termed the holy grail of diabetes treatments.

Oral insulin could fundamentally change the entire diabetes playing field since it would change the way insulin interacts with blood glucose and make the process more akin to what occurs in healthy people. Oramed is using similar technology to what Novo Nordisk is using in its own oral GLP-1 treatment, so there is reason to believe it could actually work.

Oral insulin could get prediabetics on insulin earlier since injecting insulin daily is not only inconvenient but almost taboo and a last resort. Getting prediabetics on insulin faster could go a long way in reducing late-stage complications as the disease progresses and insulin resistance sets in.

There is reason to believe insulin resistance – the factor that necessitates ever-higher doses of insulin and where most of the costs lay - will be less of a problem with an oral formulation because oral insulin goes through the liver, which is the natural organ for regulating insulin release once it receives it from the pancreas. It is a way of having the body naturally regulate insulin release rather than having to measure the dose via blood sugar analysis constantly.

All or any success amongst these three companies could take a significant bite out of overall diabetes costs over the next decade and beyond. Diabetes is by far the costliest health care niche and badly in need of a major advance. With three companies with potentially paradigm-shifting treatments in the pipe, chances are we will see that major advance before the close of this decade and before diabetes costs spiral completely out of control, if they have not done so already.",L,3.12

2017-08-22,SHPG,,"Shire: At 52-Week Low, Long-Term Opportunity Appears Significant","Shire's share price has been languishing near 52-week lows for a little while now.

Despite valid concerns about the prospect of intense competition in its important hematology franchise, the business remains attractive.

New assets in ophthalmology and oncology are generating strong results already, and additional assets look set to continue the trend.

Baxalta deal is also going well, and the potential exit from neuroscience should consolidate its reputation as the rare disease specialist at a time when orphan drug growth is expected to grow rapidly.

Combined with a highly cash-generative and healthy business, Shire looks very attractive for long-term investors right now. Shire’s* (SHPG) share price recently hit a 52-week low in both its London- and NASDAQ-listed shares. Yet, I continue to struggle to precisely see why this should be the case. Its H1 2017 results showed a company which was doing well across its franchises except neuroscience in which continued destocking in the second quarter of the year pushed it into negative growth (Data source: Q2 2017 Results):  Yet, nothing immediately jumped out as being justification for continued weakness in its share price. After all, excluding the effects of destocking, even neuroscience had seen growth.

As we will see, however, Shire is certainly facing intense competition in some of its core areas. Yet, its success in fresh R&D results, combined with current and potential corporate level changes, suggests Shire is being undervalued right now. For long-term investors, today's somewhat subdued share price seems an ideal opportunity to buy into an increasingly compelling growth story coming from the world’s global leader in rare diseases.

A Hematology Hiatus Coming?

First off, we need to reflect a little on one of the main drivers of Shire’s share price weakness. Chiefly, this has surrounded increasing potential competition in some of its core franchises. This is especially true in its hematology franchise. Picked up as part of its Baxalta acquisition in 2016, it is now the largest revenue generator in the company. Yet, investors are getting a little nervous about potential threats in this area.

The subject has been more thoroughly explored by HealthBlogger last month. Shire has, however, a leading market position in the hematology market. Its ADVATE and ADYNOVATE are approved for use in the treatment of hemophilia without inhibitor (that is, for those patients who have not developed Factor VIII inhibitors). Indeed, ADVATE is the top Factor VIII brand with proven efficacy in the market. Similarly, for those who have developed Factor VIII inhibitors, Shire markets FEIBA which is an anti-inhibitor coagulant or bypassing agent. For Shire, this latter area contributes about 23% of total hematology revenue with the former contributing the lion’s share of the rest (Data source: Q2 2017 Results): However, competition is building. Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY) has seen its emicizumab (ACE910) drug perform well against its primary and all its secondary endpoints in its Phase III trial. As it explained:

The primary endpoint showed a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in treated bleeds of 87% (risk rate [RR]=0.13, p<0.0001) with emicizumab prophylaxis compared with on-demand (no prophylaxis; episodic use only) bypassing agents.
Although Shire and Roche are taking the battle of the treatments through the court, it is clear that should it reach the market (perhaps next year), it poses a sizeable threat to Feiba’s revenue. Shire’s CEO, Flemming Ornskov, argued that, despite reservations, ACE910 could result in hefty market share losses:

While we don't know for sure how much of our approximately $800 million in annual global sales of FEIBA is at risk, and this will most certainly be impacted by the potential approval timing, the final label and the future clinical and real-world data generated from patients, we do think that the market's current expectation for up to 50% share erosion after five years post-launch is reasonable. That said, we believe there will be no one-size-fits-all approach to treating these kinds of patients, and FEIBA will remain an important therapeutic option also in the future.
Roche is also in the process of releasing data on its Phase III trial pitching emicizumab into the hemophilia without inhibitors treatment. Naturally, should this readout be strong, this poses a threat to a far larger part of hematology revenue. Undoubtedly, as HealthBlogger highlighted:

The unmet need in this segment is much lower than in the inhibitor segment, because the factor VIII replacement therapy (i.e. ADVATE) is a high efficacious therapy for these patients, but if the drug will show a similar compelling profile also in this segment, it’s reasonable to assume that Shire will lose additional market share also in this therapeutic indication.
Roche is thus posing a looming and near-term threat to Shire’s strong position in the hematology market. Other competitors are also lining up to take a share of the spoils, however. BioMarin, for instance, has seen strong results from its Phase I/II trial of its BMN 270 gene therapy. Although it still needs to pass through the larger Phase III trial, some believe that BMN 270 could be on the market by 2019. This would undoubtedly put more pressure on Shire’s hematology revenue. With other pharma companies coming up with potential new drugs to take share from Shire’s already on-market drugs, investors are understandably a bit more aware of the potential frailty in its major revenue generator.

Nonetheless, Shire has not been standing still with its own pipeline in the hematology space. Its lanadelumab (SHP643) Phase III trial for heredity angioedema (NYSE:HAE) is showing early signs of strong promise in its primary and secondary endpoints. Shire may well be facing tougher competition in its core hemophilia market, yet its broader hematology franchise appears to be continuing its strong history of advances.

Lialda Laid Low?

Shire has also been facing a tough environment for its ulcerative colitis drug, LIALDA. The drug had become the star of its internal medicine franchise and contributed nearly 6% of total revenue in Q2 2017:

News that Zydus Cadila had been given approval by the FDA to release a generic of the drug, therefore, was hardly well received by investors. The arrival of the LIALDA generic was, as Shire’s CEO Flemming Ornskov noted, “a little earlier than [they] anticipated.”

As a result, this had driven down the revenue predictions for FY 2017 to between $14.3 billion and $14.6 billion (driven, as it explained, primarily by the generics arrival). Despite this, however, it remains the only generic on the market at present and as such Shire believes it can keep its market share fairly healthy. As Ornskov explained:

in a market with one generic competitor and, for the matter, even if there was a second, we think we can maintain a reasonable share of this market in the next few years.
Clearly, however, it will impact upon margins for the drug. What is more, it is hard to argue with Ornskov when he explained that “longer term, [maintaining market share] will become increasingly difficult.”

Although an unwelcome revenue shock, however, Shire remains well-placed in its internal medicine franchise. GATTEX, its drug for short bowel syndrome, saw its constant-currency revenue growth jump 70% in Q2 2017. With Shire directing its LIALDA sales teams to focus on GATTEX, we can expect to see continued strong growth in this drugs revenue contribution. Indeed, its performance should be strong enough to soften the blow coming from the revenue declines seen in the LIALDA business.

The threats to its hematological and LIALDA revenue are certainly something to watch, yet it is important to note that Shire has a great many opportunities facing it which investors have perhaps forgotten in the face of recent news flow.

Ophthalmology Opportunity

Ophthalmology is a new business area. It opened a unit back in May 2014 seeing an opportunity to do as it has done throughout its history: fill a research vacuum in rare and specialty diseases.

XIIDRA (picked up as part of their $160 million acquisition of SARcode in 2013) received approval in July 2016. It was the first drug to treat both the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. This gives it the edge on the established market drug, RESTASIS, already generated strong revenue for Allergan (AGN). XIIDRA also has another benefit over RESTASIS: it works faster.

Unsurprisingly, therefore, XIIDRA has already shown good revenue momentum. As Jeffrey Poulton, Shire’s CFO, noted:

We continue to be pleased with the performance of XIIDRA since launch. XIIDRA contributed $57 million in sales during the quarter, as prescription demand increased 13% from Q1, with market share increasing to approximately 23% by the end of Q2.
Indeed, it has already built up its market share rapidly since it was launched (Data source: Q1 2017 Results Presentation): Yet, here is the thing, this is a huge market share despite the fact that XIIDRA has not yet gained access to a large part of the DED market. As Poulton added at Q1 2017:

Importantly, this very impressive [market share] gain has been primarily driven by our ability to command share in the commercial insurance market, where XIIDRA has broad coverage. In the commercial market alone, our share is, of course, much higher than 22%. As you may know, we do not have broad Medicare coverage yet. I remain optimistic that we will be able to improve access to the Medicare population, who accounts for more than 40% of the current dry eye disease market.
Adding later that:

We’re building this [XIIDRA] brand into a blockbuster like we did with VYVANSE, step-by-step, keeping in mind we have patents until 2029 and expect few potential competitive entrants before XIIDRA’s patent expiry.
What is more, Shire has good pipeline prospects for building a more broad-based ophthalmology franchise. As well as additional DED developments, it has good trial progress in glaucoma and infectious conjunctivitis (Source: Shire Ophthalmology Pipeline in July 2017):",L,1.81

I'm like the man from Texas. You see, the man from Missouri always says, 'You've got to show me.' But the man from Texas says, 'You've got to put it in my hand.'"" —Jack London
Novavax (NASDAQ: NVAX) is a clinical-stage biotech company with an enviable pipeline, including a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a disease that afflicts millions of people around the world. Novavax's maternal RSV vaccine candidate is in the Phase III clinical trial stage. Novavax's work toward a viable RSV vaccine won the backing of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2015, including up to $89 million in grants to support the development and clinical trials of a maternal vaccine.

Novavax's story goes well beyond just one vaccine, with other prospective drugs in the pipeline, including vaccines for the Zika virus and Ebola, as well as a novel nanoparticle flu vaccine that utilizes the company's proprietary Matrix-M adjuvant.

This would all seem to add up to an exceptional story. Unfortunately, there is a very serious hitch: In September 2016, the Phase III clinical trial of Novavax's RSV vaccine for elderly patients, dubbed “Resolve”, laid an egg. The trial failed to meet both its primary and secondary endpoints. The market reacted as one would expect, with Novavax's share price taking a more than 83 percent dive overnight. Since then, the stock has slipped further and now trades around $1.00 per share. That is a far cry from the $8.34 per share posted the day the Resolve trial results were announced.",L,8.0

Launched 20 years ago, chief executive Robert Blum was with the firm from the start, leading in R&D and ultimately taking the tiller a few years after they went public in 2004.

Commenting on the company’s philosophy, Mr Blum points to: ""A pipeline that builds on one another, in terms of economies in drug discovery and synergies in drug development activities.""

Amgen collaboration in heart failure

As an example, he cites the company’s long-standing collaboration with fellow Californian biotech Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN), which he says has enabled investment in longer shots such as tirasemtiv.

""[Omecamtiv mecarbil] could ultimately be our most valuable program, and that has afforded us some advantages.""

""That's how we can make the commitment, take the risk, on tirasemtiv. Because we have partnered in other programs, most importantly omecamtiv mecarbil, with Amgen.”

“That could ultimately be our most valuable program, and that has afforded us some advantages. This candidate addresses a very large unmet need - high-risk heart failure patients who are recently hospitalized and therefore at high risk of death or readmission.”

“Heart failure is the largest cardiovascular market that is not well served by existing therapies. It's the number one reason why people over the age of 65 are hospitalized and the single largest line item in the pharmacotherapy budget for Medicare.”

Through its collaborations, Cytokinetics has been able to raise primarily non-diutive capital of over $500 million.

The economic potential in one program feeds into the rest of the company’s portfolio.

Mr Blum says: “As the drug went into Phase III it triggered milestone payments that enabled us to co-invest with Amgen to buy up our royalty economics.”

“We then sold a piece of those to generate additional capital, that we could invest in tirasemtiv.”

“I think this is most possible when you can organically build a pipeline by being the leader in one slice of biology. That affords these kinds of opportunities.""

Astellas collaboration in ALS

As well as Amgen, Cytokinetics is partnered with Japan’s Astellas Pharma (TYO: 4503), this time to develop treatments in neuromuscular indications.

While traditional approaches to ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, have sought to combat the condition from the perspective of nerve decay, Cytokinetics is looking at the disease through the prism of muscle biology, “remaining agnostic as to why the nerves may be degenerating.”

Mr Blum says: “We do know that the muscles are ultimately where the action is in the disease. Patients who live with ALS suffer a ruthless decline of muscle function, and typically die within three to four years, of respiratory failure and pneumonia.""

Cytokinetics believes its compound will be able to increase muscle force, empower and delay the time to muscle weakness and fatigue.

Recognizing the high burden of the disease and the high level of unmet need In ALS, Mr Blum says: “We knew that that could provide a very meaningful new opportunity to address the disease in ways unlike any other.""

The deal with Astellas was synergistic, as both companies are operating in the same research space. Mr Blum saw an advantage to combining their programs, as the company is: “making a major commitment to muscle biology, and employing different approaches that we thought to be quite complementary to ours.""

Cytokinetics has sold to Astellas an option on tirasemtiv, which would provide rights to co-develop and co-commercialize the drug outside of North America and Europe, where the American firm retains exclusivity.

Mr Blum says data from a large Phase III trial into the candidate will be presented at the annual International Symposium on ALS/MND, in Boston, in December.

“This is designed to confirm and extend findings from our earlier studies.”

""If the data are positive, we as a company are ready for regulatory filings in the US and Europe by mid-2018 to support our commercial activities. We're intending to commercialize this drug candidate ourselves in North America and Europe.""

Positive regulatory environment for ALS

Of particular interest in this therapeutic area is the recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of Radicava (edaravone), the first new drug in ALS for over two decades.

""The handwriting on the wall suggests that the division of neurology is accelerating review and approval of certain drugs for high unmet need.”

Unusually, the positive decision was the result of the FDA calling on the drugmaker, Japan’s Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma (TYO: 4508), to file for marketing authorization.

Asked whether this suggests a more positive approach toward expediting therapies, including for ALS, Mr Blum says: ""Yes, I think it probably does. The handwriting on the wall suggests that the division of neurology is accelerating review and approval of certain drugs for high unmet need.”

""What was noteworthy about the approval was that the trials seemed to be conflicting in terms of efficacy. I think the FDA was compelled by the fact that the drug appears to be safe, and they approved the drug subject to post-marketing conditions.""

""It's an important advance for the field, to be sure, but I think it will be interesting to see how it will be commercialized, and what the uptake will be.""

Under the stewardship of new FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, the FDA appears to be taking a more proactive approach, including hiring more staff, to bring innovative therapies to patients expeditiously.

Asked about progress at the FDA, Mr Blum says: ""From what I can see, things are moving forward very constructively. I think there's an opportunity for patients, caregivers, regulatory authorities, industry sponsors and everybody to align more on innovation, and create opportunities for new medicines that are truly innovative, to move forward swiftly.""
""I think the changes at the FDA underscore their commitment to the original intent of biopharmaceutical innovation, and that's the most encouraging sign coming out of Washington.""",L,4.42

2017-08-21,BMY,https://www.mesotheliomahelp.org/2017/08/results-opdivo-trial-may-help-mesothelioma-oncologists-identify-patients-will-benefit-drug/,,"In April, MesotheliomaHelp reported on the findings of a phase I clinical trial showing that the five-year survival rate for some lung cancer patients treated with Opdivo (nivolumab), an immunotherapy treatment, was “much higher” than historical data. Now, researchers report that results from a phase III clinical trial may help oncologists determine those lung cancer patients, and possibly, mesothelioma patients, who will benefit from the immuno-oncology drug.

Opdivo, developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, works by blocking the PD-L1 protein and activating the immune system, leading it to attack and kill cancer cells. According to a June 21 press release from The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, a team of researchers led by David Carbone, MD, PhD, of The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer – Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute, found that although the trial did not improve progression-free survival when compared with chemotherapy in the overall population, those patients with a high expression of PD-L1 did benefit.

“The good news is that we discovered that a subset of patients who had both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status did experience a significant benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

Specifically, the researchers report that patients who had “both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status” realized a 75 percent response rate compared to just 16 percent response rate with low mutation burden and low PDL-1. However, the response rates for chemotherapy treatment in these same subsets were nearly the same leading the researchers to conclude that the PDL-1 markers “were selective for immunotherapy.”

Mesothelioma, a rare, asbestos-related cancer of the lining of the lungs, abdomen or heart, is highly aggressive and is resistant to many cancer treatments. The prognosis for mesothelioma patients is usually grim: the average survival time varies from 4 – 18 months after diagnosis. For the close to 3,000 Americans diagnosed with the disease each year, personalized care may bring a breakthrough treatment not previously considered by their physician.

The benefits of personalized care for mesothelioma patients have been proven where researchers have identified genetic biomarkers that reflect the aggressiveness of mesothelioma as well as markers that can assess the effectiveness of a particular treatment.

Opdivo is currently in a phase III clinical trial in the UK for mesothelioma patients. Known as The CheckpOiNt Blockade For Inhibition of Relapsed Mesothelioma, or CONIFRM, the trial has a goal of ‘exploiting the potential of immunotherapy.’

Keytruda, which gained popularity after saving former President Jimmy Carter’s life after sending his melanoma into remission, is also a PD-L1 inhibitor. Both immunotherapy drugs have shown in studies to be effective in fighting pleural mesothelioma. Keytruda is, perhaps, more well known due to eight-year mesothelioma survivor Mavis Nye of England, who went into remission after a two-year clinical trial of the drug.

“This study is an important step toward understanding the impact of tumor mutation burden and PDL-1 in immunotherapy response. This data shows we should evaluate these two factors independently to most accurately define who will benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

About Recro Pharma, Inc.

Recro is a specialty pharmaceutical company that operates through two business divisions, an Acute Care, hospital product division and a revenue-generating contract development and manufacturing, or CDMO division, located at the Company's Gainesville facility. The Acute Care division is primarily focused on developing innovative products for hospital and other acute care settings. The Company's lead product candidate is a proprietary injectable form of meloxicam, a long-acting preferential COX-2 inhibitor. IV meloxicam 30mg has successfully completed two pivotal Phase III clinical efficacy trials in patients following bunionectomy and abdominoplasty surgeries, a large double blind Phase III safety trial, four Phase II clinical trials for the management of moderate to severe post-operative pain, as well as other safety studies. As injectable meloxicam is in the non-opioid class of drugs, the Company believes it will overcome many of the issues associated with commonly prescribed opioid therapeutics, including respiratory depression, constipation, excessive nausea and vomiting, as well as having no addictive potential while maintaining meaningful analgesic effects for relief of pain. The Company's CDMO division leverages its formulation expertise to develop and manufacture pharmaceutical products using its proprietary delivery technologies and other manufacturing services for commercial partners who commercialize or plan to commercialize these products. These collaborations can result in revenue streams including royalties, profit sharing, research and development and manufacturing fees, which support continued operations for its CDMO division and it contributes non-dilutive funding for the development and pre-commercialization activities of its Acute Care division.

2017-08-21,IRWD,https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Ironwood+Pharma+%28IRWD%29+Announces+FDA+Approval+of+DUZALLO+for+Treatment+of+Hyperuricemia+in+Patients+with+Uncontrolled+Gout/13222622.html,,"Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IRWD) today announced DUZALLO was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a once-daily oral treatment for hyperuricemia associated with gout in patients who have not achieved target serum uric acid (sUA) levels with a medically appropriate daily dose of allopurinol alone. DUZALLO is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Ironwood expects DUZALLO to be commercially available early in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Gout is a highly symptomatic and painful form of inflammatory arthritis caused by hyperuricemia, or elevated sUA levels in the blood, which can lead to painful flares and serious potential long-term health consequences.DUZALLO is the first drug that combines the current standard of care for the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout, allopurinol, with the most recent FDA-approved treatment for this condition, lesinurad. This fixed-dose combination provides a dual mechanism of action in a single tablet that can address both underlying causes of hyperuricemia – overproduction and underexcretion of serum uric acid.

“The approval of DUZALLO provides a new fixed-dose and dual-mechanism treatment option to help patients with uncontrolled gout achieve target serum uric acid levels. This represents an important and needed new option in the treatment of hyperuricemia,” said Michael A. Becker, M.D., professor emeritus of medicine, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL. “Gout is a serious and potentially progressive and debilitating inflammatory disease. Getting patients with gout to serum urate goal, and keeping them at or below goal, are essential to success in treating these patients. DUZALLO will help reduce the significant unmet need among patients in the U.S. who fail to get their serum uric acid levels to goal despite taking allopurinol alone.”

“With DUZALLO, nearly twice as many patients with uncontrolled gout may be able to achieve target serum uric acid levels compared to those patients taking allopurinol alone, which is important, considering the significant unmet need among uncontrolled gout patients to get to goal of under 6 mg/dL,” said Tom McCourt, senior vice president of marketing and sales and chief commercial officer at Ironwood. “We believe DUZALLO will be the critical driver behind Ironwood’s gout franchise, which is expected to exceed total annual U.S. peak sales of $300 million.”",L,2.65
2017-08-21,NVO,https://www.gurufocus.com/news/556495/3-companies-aiming-to-significantly-reduce-diabetes-treatment-costs,,"Total U.S. health care spending in 2015 was an astronomical $3.2 trillion. That is 16% of the entire national debt. As much as we blame the prices of new drugs for this gargantuan sum, one of the biggest chunks of it comes from diabetes, a disease whose treatment has not changed all that much since 1922. According to the American Diabetes Association, diabetes accounts for $322 billion in total U.S. health care spending as of 2016.

One Harvard study puts the annual cost at a much higher $822 billion annually. Whichever number you want to believe, it is among the costliest diseases in the world, for both patients and taxpayers. Thanks to Medicare and Medicaid, diabetes costs are socialized.



There are two reasons for the rising costs. First, the price of insulin has tripled since 2002. Second, the nature of lifetime treatment necessitates ever-rising doses of insulin as the disease progresses.

Short of hoping Americans radically change their diets overnight and drastically reduce sugar intake, the problem is not going away. But there is hope for significant cost reduction nonetheless. Here are three companies on the cutting edge of the newest diabetes advancements that, with some luck, may help reduce this nearly unfathomable cost to the U.S. economy and taxpayers.

Novo Nordisk and semaglutide

Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) recently announced its once-weekly GLP-1 agonist semaglutide handily beat Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide in terms of weight loss and blood sugar control in a pivotal Phase III trial. GLP-1 agonists, unlike insulin, stimulate pancreatic cells to produce insulin in a glucose-dependent manner. Meaning, GLP-1 agonists only induce native insulin production when blood glucose levels are high enough to trigger it. This is much more convenient than manually measuring blood sugar before injecting insulin directly.

While markets are focused on the one-on-one beat, raising Novo shares at the expense of Eli Lilly’s, there is potentially more exciting news regarding semaglutide yet to come. Novo Nordisk has already demonstrated in a Phase II trial that an oral formulation of semaglutide can work as well. If this continues into Phase III, the implication could be big for diabetes treatment costs. Oral formulations of otherwise intravenous drugs increase patient compliance and, if it works better than GLP-1 agonists currently on the market, it could keep diabetes patients healthier for longer, reducing long-run costs as the disease progresses, by far the costliest aspect of diabetes.

Roche and the artificial pancreas

Another innovative way to increase patient compliance and reduce long-run costs is to simply automate everything. Roche Holding AG (RHHBY) is currently sponsoring a late-stage development of an artificial pancreas that uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology together with an insulin pump to keep diabetics’ blood sugar in perpetual balance.

A pivotal Phase III trial was announced late last month, cosponsored by Roche Diabetics Care Inc. The ingenious closed-loop system uses a smartphone app to notify patients when blood sugar levels go out of range of preset limits. Since most of the damage from diabetes occurs when patients are out of their blood sugar target ranges, by keeping diabetics range-bound for longer, and hopefully perpetually, much of the cumulative damage from diabetes can hopefully be blunted or maybe even prevented for the long run. This closed-loop artificial pancreas is currently intended for Type 1 diabetics, though if successful it may be trialed for the much more prevalent Type 2 population.

Oramed and oral insulin

Perhaps the most ambitious of new diabetes treatments is an oral insulin formulation from Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ORMP). Oramed just recently announced a planned Phase III trial for what has been termed the holy grail of diabetes treatments.

Oral insulin could fundamentally change the entire diabetes playing field since it would change the way insulin interacts with blood glucose and make the process more akin to what occurs in healthy people. Oramed is using similar technology to what Novo Nordisk is using in its own oral GLP-1 treatment, so there is reason to believe it could actually work.

Oral insulin could get prediabetics on insulin earlier since injecting insulin daily is not only inconvenient but almost taboo and a last resort. Getting prediabetics on insulin faster could go a long way in reducing late-stage complications as the disease progresses and insulin resistance sets in.

There is reason to believe insulin resistance – the factor that necessitates ever-higher doses of insulin and where most of the costs lay - will be less of a problem with an oral formulation because oral insulin goes through the liver, which is the natural organ for regulating insulin release once it receives it from the pancreas. It is a way of having the body naturally regulate insulin release rather than having to measure the dose via blood sugar analysis constantly.

All or any success amongst these three companies could take a significant bite out of overall diabetes costs over the next decade and beyond. Diabetes is by far the costliest health care niche and badly in need of a major advance. With three companies with potentially paradigm-shifting treatments in the pipe, chances are we will see that major advance before the close of this decade and before diabetes costs spiral completely out of control, if they have not done so already.",L,1.03

Novo Nordisk and semaglutide

Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) recently announced its once-weekly GLP-1 agonist semaglutide handily beat Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide in terms of weight loss and blood sugar control in a pivotal Phase III trial. GLP-1 agonists, unlike insulin, stimulate pancreatic cells to produce insulin in a glucose-dependent manner. Meaning, GLP-1 agonists only induce native insulin production when blood glucose levels are high enough to trigger it. This is much more convenient than manually measuring blood sugar before injecting insulin directly.

While markets are focused on the one-on-one beat, raising Novo shares at the expense of Eli Lilly’s, there is potentially more exciting news regarding semaglutide yet to come. Novo Nordisk has already demonstrated in a Phase II trial that an oral formulation of semaglutide can work as well. If this continues into Phase III, the implication could be big for diabetes treatment costs. Oral formulations of otherwise intravenous drugs increase patient compliance and, if it works better than GLP-1 agonists currently on the market, it could keep diabetes patients healthier for longer, reducing long-run costs as the disease progresses, by far the costliest aspect of diabetes.

Roche and the artificial pancreas

Another innovative way to increase patient compliance and reduce long-run costs is to simply automate everything. Roche Holding AG (RHHBY) is currently sponsoring a late-stage development of an artificial pancreas that uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology together with an insulin pump to keep diabetics’ blood sugar in perpetual balance.

A pivotal Phase III trial was announced late last month, cosponsored by Roche Diabetics Care Inc. The ingenious closed-loop system uses a smartphone app to notify patients when blood sugar levels go out of range of preset limits. Since most of the damage from diabetes occurs when patients are out of their blood sugar target ranges, by keeping diabetics range-bound for longer, and hopefully perpetually, much of the cumulative damage from diabetes can hopefully be blunted or maybe even prevented for the long run. This closed-loop artificial pancreas is currently intended for Type 1 diabetics, though if successful it may be trialed for the much more prevalent Type 2 population.

Oramed and oral insulin

Perhaps the most ambitious of new diabetes treatments is an oral insulin formulation from Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ORMP). Oramed just recently announced a planned Phase III trial for what has been termed the holy grail of diabetes treatments.

Oral insulin could fundamentally change the entire diabetes playing field since it would change the way insulin interacts with blood glucose and make the process more akin to what occurs in healthy people. Oramed is using similar technology to what Novo Nordisk is using in its own oral GLP-1 treatment, so there is reason to believe it could actually work.

Oral insulin could get prediabetics on insulin earlier since injecting insulin daily is not only inconvenient but almost taboo and a last resort. Getting prediabetics on insulin faster could go a long way in reducing late-stage complications as the disease progresses and insulin resistance sets in.

2017-08-22,SHPG,,"Shire: At 52-Week Low, Long-Term Opportunity Appears Significant","Shire's share price has been languishing near 52-week lows for a little while now.

Despite valid concerns about the prospect of intense competition in its important hematology franchise, the business remains attractive.

New assets in ophthalmology and oncology are generating strong results already, and additional assets look set to continue the trend.

Baxalta deal is also going well, and the potential exit from neuroscience should consolidate its reputation as the rare disease specialist at a time when orphan drug growth is expected to grow rapidly.

Combined with a highly cash-generative and healthy business, Shire looks very attractive for long-term investors right now. Shire’s* (SHPG) share price recently hit a 52-week low in both its London- and NASDAQ-listed shares. Yet, I continue to struggle to precisely see why this should be the case. Its H1 2017 results showed a company which was doing well across its franchises except neuroscience in which continued destocking in the second quarter of the year pushed it into negative growth (Data source: Q2 2017 Results):  Yet, nothing immediately jumped out as being justification for continued weakness in its share price. After all, excluding the effects of destocking, even neuroscience had seen growth.

As we will see, however, Shire is certainly facing intense competition in some of its core areas. Yet, its success in fresh R&D results, combined with current and potential corporate level changes, suggests Shire is being undervalued right now. For long-term investors, today's somewhat subdued share price seems an ideal opportunity to buy into an increasingly compelling growth story coming from the world’s global leader in rare diseases.

A Hematology Hiatus Coming?

First off, we need to reflect a little on one of the main drivers of Shire’s share price weakness. Chiefly, this has surrounded increasing potential competition in some of its core franchises. This is especially true in its hematology franchise. Picked up as part of its Baxalta acquisition in 2016, it is now the largest revenue generator in the company. Yet, investors are getting a little nervous about potential threats in this area.

The subject has been more thoroughly explored by HealthBlogger last month. Shire has, however, a leading market position in the hematology market. Its ADVATE and ADYNOVATE are approved for use in the treatment of hemophilia without inhibitor (that is, for those patients who have not developed Factor VIII inhibitors). Indeed, ADVATE is the top Factor VIII brand with proven efficacy in the market. Similarly, for those who have developed Factor VIII inhibitors, Shire markets FEIBA which is an anti-inhibitor coagulant or bypassing agent. For Shire, this latter area contributes about 23% of total hematology revenue with the former contributing the lion’s share of the rest (Data source: Q2 2017 Results): However, competition is building. Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY) has seen its emicizumab (ACE910) drug perform well against its primary and all its secondary endpoints in its Phase III trial. As it explained:

The primary endpoint showed a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in treated bleeds of 87% (risk rate [RR]=0.13, p<0.0001) with emicizumab prophylaxis compared with on-demand (no prophylaxis; episodic use only) bypassing agents.
Although Shire and Roche are taking the battle of the treatments through the court, it is clear that should it reach the market (perhaps next year), it poses a sizeable threat to Feiba’s revenue. Shire’s CEO, Flemming Ornskov, argued that, despite reservations, ACE910 could result in hefty market share losses:

While we don't know for sure how much of our approximately $800 million in annual global sales of FEIBA is at risk, and this will most certainly be impacted by the potential approval timing, the final label and the future clinical and real-world data generated from patients, we do think that the market's current expectation for up to 50% share erosion after five years post-launch is reasonable. That said, we believe there will be no one-size-fits-all approach to treating these kinds of patients, and FEIBA will remain an important therapeutic option also in the future.
Roche is also in the process of releasing data on its Phase III trial pitching emicizumab into the hemophilia without inhibitors treatment. Naturally, should this readout be strong, this poses a threat to a far larger part of hematology revenue. Undoubtedly, as HealthBlogger highlighted:

The unmet need in this segment is much lower than in the inhibitor segment, because the factor VIII replacement therapy (i.e. ADVATE) is a high efficacious therapy for these patients, but if the drug will show a similar compelling profile also in this segment, it’s reasonable to assume that Shire will lose additional market share also in this therapeutic indication.
Roche is thus posing a looming and near-term threat to Shire’s strong position in the hematology market. Other competitors are also lining up to take a share of the spoils, however. BioMarin, for instance, has seen strong results from its Phase I/II trial of its BMN 270 gene therapy. Although it still needs to pass through the larger Phase III trial, some believe that BMN 270 could be on the market by 2019. This would undoubtedly put more pressure on Shire’s hematology revenue. With other pharma companies coming up with potential new drugs to take share from Shire’s already on-market drugs, investors are understandably a bit more aware of the potential frailty in its major revenue generator.

Nonetheless, Shire has not been standing still with its own pipeline in the hematology space. Its lanadelumab (SHP643) Phase III trial for heredity angioedema (NYSE:HAE) is showing early signs of strong promise in its primary and secondary endpoints. Shire may well be facing tougher competition in its core hemophilia market, yet its broader hematology franchise appears to be continuing its strong history of advances.

Lialda Laid Low?

Shire has also been facing a tough environment for its ulcerative colitis drug, LIALDA. The drug had become the star of its internal medicine franchise and contributed nearly 6% of total revenue in Q2 2017:

News that Zydus Cadila had been given approval by the FDA to release a generic of the drug, therefore, was hardly well received by investors. The arrival of the LIALDA generic was, as Shire’s CEO Flemming Ornskov noted, “a little earlier than [they] anticipated.”

As a result, this had driven down the revenue predictions for FY 2017 to between $14.3 billion and $14.6 billion (driven, as it explained, primarily by the generics arrival). Despite this, however, it remains the only generic on the market at present and as such Shire believes it can keep its market share fairly healthy. As Ornskov explained:

in a market with one generic competitor and, for the matter, even if there was a second, we think we can maintain a reasonable share of this market in the next few years.
Clearly, however, it will impact upon margins for the drug. What is more, it is hard to argue with Ornskov when he explained that “longer term, [maintaining market share] will become increasingly difficult.”

Although an unwelcome revenue shock, however, Shire remains well-placed in its internal medicine franchise. GATTEX, its drug for short bowel syndrome, saw its constant-currency revenue growth jump 70% in Q2 2017. With Shire directing its LIALDA sales teams to focus on GATTEX, we can expect to see continued strong growth in this drugs revenue contribution. Indeed, its performance should be strong enough to soften the blow coming from the revenue declines seen in the LIALDA business.

The threats to its hematological and LIALDA revenue are certainly something to watch, yet it is important to note that Shire has a great many opportunities facing it which investors have perhaps forgotten in the face of recent news flow.

Ophthalmology Opportunity

Ophthalmology is a new business area. It opened a unit back in May 2014 seeing an opportunity to do as it has done throughout its history: fill a research vacuum in rare and specialty diseases.

XIIDRA (picked up as part of their $160 million acquisition of SARcode in 2013) received approval in July 2016. It was the first drug to treat both the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. This gives it the edge on the established market drug, RESTASIS, already generated strong revenue for Allergan (AGN). XIIDRA also has another benefit over RESTASIS: it works faster.

Unsurprisingly, therefore, XIIDRA has already shown good revenue momentum. As Jeffrey Poulton, Shire’s CFO, noted:

We continue to be pleased with the performance of XIIDRA since launch. XIIDRA contributed $57 million in sales during the quarter, as prescription demand increased 13% from Q1, with market share increasing to approximately 23% by the end of Q2.
Indeed, it has already built up its market share rapidly since it was launched (Data source: Q1 2017 Results Presentation): Yet, here is the thing, this is a huge market share despite the fact that XIIDRA has not yet gained access to a large part of the DED market. As Poulton added at Q1 2017:

Importantly, this very impressive [market share] gain has been primarily driven by our ability to command share in the commercial insurance market, where XIIDRA has broad coverage. In the commercial market alone, our share is, of course, much higher than 22%. As you may know, we do not have broad Medicare coverage yet. I remain optimistic that we will be able to improve access to the Medicare population, who accounts for more than 40% of the current dry eye disease market.
Adding later that:

We’re building this [XIIDRA] brand into a blockbuster like we did with VYVANSE, step-by-step, keeping in mind we have patents until 2029 and expect few potential competitive entrants before XIIDRA’s patent expiry.
What is more, Shire has good pipeline prospects for building a more broad-based ophthalmology franchise. As well as additional DED developments, it has good trial progress in glaucoma and infectious conjunctivitis (Source: Shire Ophthalmology Pipeline in July 2017):",L,1.81

Concerns over Novavax’s ability to finance itself to the end of the maternal vaccine trial without dilution have further dampened investor sentiment.

Evidence suggests the next RSV vaccine trial will not be a repetition of the 2016 failure, but will succeed in line with past Phase II trials.

With negativity depressing the share price, a buying opportunity has emerged.

I'm like the man from Texas. You see, the man from Missouri always says, 'You've got to show me.' But the man from Texas says, 'You've got to put it in my hand.'"" —Jack London
Novavax (NASDAQ: NVAX) is a clinical-stage biotech company with an enviable pipeline, including a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a disease that afflicts millions of people around the world. Novavax's maternal RSV vaccine candidate is in the Phase III clinical trial stage. Novavax's work toward a viable RSV vaccine won the backing of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2015, including up to $89 million in grants to support the development and clinical trials of a maternal vaccine.

Novavax's story goes well beyond just one vaccine, with other prospective drugs in the pipeline, including vaccines for the Zika virus and Ebola, as well as a novel nanoparticle flu vaccine that utilizes the company's proprietary Matrix-M adjuvant.

This would all seem to add up to an exceptional story. Unfortunately, there is a very serious hitch: In September 2016, the Phase III clinical trial of Novavax's RSV vaccine for elderly patients, dubbed “Resolve”, laid an egg. The trial failed to meet both its primary and secondary endpoints. The market reacted as one would expect, with Novavax's share price taking a more than 83 percent dive overnight. Since then, the stock has slipped further and now trades around $1.00 per share. That is a far cry from the $8.34 per share posted the day the Resolve trial results were announced.",L,8.0

Abeona - a ""String of Pearls"" Strategy with each Pearl Potentially Worth >$30/ share in NPV

Abeona (ABEO) is a small cap biotech company that I have written about in the past (see Abeona: Preparing For Liftoff - The Next AveXis?). In my opinion, this stock has the potential to be >$100/ share in 24-36 months, driven by the commercialization of five gene therapy products for rare diseases that currently have no available treatment options.

This company uses an identical AAV9 vector to that employed by AveXis (AVXS) for their SMA gene therapy product. Initial data from the first six patients is extremely encouraging demonstrating a dose response in biomarkers (such as urinary GAG and CSF GAG) and suggestive evidence that the patients are experiencing a neurocognitive benefit. In fact, the clinical trial data presented during the past six months on this product really couldn't have been any better. You can read about this product in my initial report and see the initial clinical trial data in the company presentation.

2017-08-22,CYTK,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/handwriting-on-the-wall-suggests-progress-in-als-may-be-imminent-says-cytokinetics-ceo," 'Writing on the wall' suggests progress in ALS may be imminent, says Cytokinetics CEO","San Franciscan firm Cytokinetics (Nasdaq: CYTK) is pursuing an unusual angle to therapeutic discovery, starting from an understanding of the biology of muscles in order to explore treatment options in different disease areas.

This approach has seen the company develop a diverse pipeline of candidates, in heart failure, in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where lead candidate tirasemtiv is due to read out at Phase III later this year.

Launched 20 years ago, chief executive Robert Blum was with the firm from the start, leading in R&D and ultimately taking the tiller a few years after they went public in 2004.

Commenting on the company’s philosophy, Mr Blum points to: ""A pipeline that builds on one another, in terms of economies in drug discovery and synergies in drug development activities.""

Amgen collaboration in heart failure

As an example, he cites the company’s long-standing collaboration with fellow Californian biotech Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN), which he says has enabled investment in longer shots such as tirasemtiv.

""[Omecamtiv mecarbil] could ultimately be our most valuable program, and that has afforded us some advantages.""

""That's how we can make the commitment, take the risk, on tirasemtiv. Because we have partnered in other programs, most importantly omecamtiv mecarbil, with Amgen.”

“That could ultimately be our most valuable program, and that has afforded us some advantages. This candidate addresses a very large unmet need - high-risk heart failure patients who are recently hospitalized and therefore at high risk of death or readmission.”

“Heart failure is the largest cardiovascular market that is not well served by existing therapies. It's the number one reason why people over the age of 65 are hospitalized and the single largest line item in the pharmacotherapy budget for Medicare.”

Through its collaborations, Cytokinetics has been able to raise primarily non-diutive capital of over $500 million.

The economic potential in one program feeds into the rest of the company’s portfolio.

Mr Blum says: “As the drug went into Phase III it triggered milestone payments that enabled us to co-invest with Amgen to buy up our royalty economics.”

“We then sold a piece of those to generate additional capital, that we could invest in tirasemtiv.”

“I think this is most possible when you can organically build a pipeline by being the leader in one slice of biology. That affords these kinds of opportunities.""

Astellas collaboration in ALS

As well as Amgen, Cytokinetics is partnered with Japan’s Astellas Pharma (TYO: 4503), this time to develop treatments in neuromuscular indications.

While traditional approaches to ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, have sought to combat the condition from the perspective of nerve decay, Cytokinetics is looking at the disease through the prism of muscle biology, “remaining agnostic as to why the nerves may be degenerating.”

Mr Blum says: “We do know that the muscles are ultimately where the action is in the disease. Patients who live with ALS suffer a ruthless decline of muscle function, and typically die within three to four years, of respiratory failure and pneumonia.""

Cytokinetics believes its compound will be able to increase muscle force, empower and delay the time to muscle weakness and fatigue.

Recognizing the high burden of the disease and the high level of unmet need In ALS, Mr Blum says: “We knew that that could provide a very meaningful new opportunity to address the disease in ways unlike any other.""

The deal with Astellas was synergistic, as both companies are operating in the same research space. Mr Blum saw an advantage to combining their programs, as the company is: “making a major commitment to muscle biology, and employing different approaches that we thought to be quite complementary to ours.""

Cytokinetics has sold to Astellas an option on tirasemtiv, which would provide rights to co-develop and co-commercialize the drug outside of North America and Europe, where the American firm retains exclusivity.

Mr Blum says data from a large Phase III trial into the candidate will be presented at the annual International Symposium on ALS/MND, in Boston, in December.

“This is designed to confirm and extend findings from our earlier studies.”

""If the data are positive, we as a company are ready for regulatory filings in the US and Europe by mid-2018 to support our commercial activities. We're intending to commercialize this drug candidate ourselves in North America and Europe.""

Positive regulatory environment for ALS

Of particular interest in this therapeutic area is the recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of Radicava (edaravone), the first new drug in ALS for over two decades.

""The handwriting on the wall suggests that the division of neurology is accelerating review and approval of certain drugs for high unmet need.”

Unusually, the positive decision was the result of the FDA calling on the drugmaker, Japan’s Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma (TYO: 4508), to file for marketing authorization.

Asked whether this suggests a more positive approach toward expediting therapies, including for ALS, Mr Blum says: ""Yes, I think it probably does. The handwriting on the wall suggests that the division of neurology is accelerating review and approval of certain drugs for high unmet need.”

""What was noteworthy about the approval was that the trials seemed to be conflicting in terms of efficacy. I think the FDA was compelled by the fact that the drug appears to be safe, and they approved the drug subject to post-marketing conditions.""

""It's an important advance for the field, to be sure, but I think it will be interesting to see how it will be commercialized, and what the uptake will be.""

Under the stewardship of new FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, the FDA appears to be taking a more proactive approach, including hiring more staff, to bring innovative therapies to patients expeditiously.

Asked about progress at the FDA, Mr Blum says: ""From what I can see, things are moving forward very constructively. I think there's an opportunity for patients, caregivers, regulatory authorities, industry sponsors and everybody to align more on innovation, and create opportunities for new medicines that are truly innovative, to move forward swiftly.""
""I think the changes at the FDA underscore their commitment to the original intent of biopharmaceutical innovation, and that's the most encouraging sign coming out of Washington.""",L,4.42

Now, researchers report that results from a phase III clinical trial may help oncologists determine those lung cancer patients, and possibly, mesothelioma patients, who will benefit from the immuno-oncology drug.

Opdivo, developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, works by blocking the PD-L1 protein and activating the immune system, leading it to attack and kill cancer cells. According to a June 21 press release from The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, a team of researchers led by David Carbone, MD, PhD, of The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer – Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute, found that although the trial did not improve progression-free survival when compared with chemotherapy in the overall population, those patients with a high expression of PD-L1 did benefit.

“The good news is that we discovered that a subset of patients who had both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status did experience a significant benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

Specifically, the researchers report that patients who had “both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status” realized a 75 percent response rate compared to just 16 percent response rate with low mutation burden and low PDL-1. However, the response rates for chemotherapy treatment in these same subsets were nearly the same leading the researchers to conclude that the PDL-1 markers “were selective for immunotherapy.”

Mesothelioma, a rare, asbestos-related cancer of the lining of the lungs, abdomen or heart, is highly aggressive and is resistant to many cancer treatments. The prognosis for mesothelioma patients is usually grim: the average survival time varies from 4 – 18 months after diagnosis. For the close to 3,000 Americans diagnosed with the disease each year, personalized care may bring a breakthrough treatment not previously considered by their physician.

The benefits of personalized care for mesothelioma patients have been proven where researchers have identified genetic biomarkers that reflect the aggressiveness of mesothelioma as well as markers that can assess the effectiveness of a particular treatment.

Opdivo is currently in a phase III clinical trial in the UK for mesothelioma patients. Known as The CheckpOiNt Blockade For Inhibition of Relapsed Mesothelioma, or CONIFRM, the trial has a goal of ‘exploiting the potential of immunotherapy.’

Keytruda, which gained popularity after saving former President Jimmy Carter’s life after sending his melanoma into remission, is also a PD-L1 inhibitor. Both immunotherapy drugs have shown in studies to be effective in fighting pleural mesothelioma. Keytruda is, perhaps, more well known due to eight-year mesothelioma survivor Mavis Nye of England, who went into remission after a two-year clinical trial of the drug.

“This study is an important step toward understanding the impact of tumor mutation burden and PDL-1 in immunotherapy response. This data shows we should evaluate these two factors independently to most accurately define who will benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

(CRME) (COM.TO) plunged more than 32% on Monday as the FDA is not satisfied with the data package proposed by the Company to support the resubmission of its Brinavess New Drug Application.

Brinavess is used to rapidly restore normal heart rhythm in adult patients (aged 18 years or over) who have recently started having atrial fibrillation.

In its most recent communication with the FDA, the Company proposed resubmission of the NDA based upon the original file and six years of accumulated safety data from sales of BRINAVESS in thirty-three countries, augmented by interim results from over 1,100 patients enrolled in the SPECTRUM study, a prospective post-authorization European Union safety study, along with pre-clinical data from subsequent studies the Company completed at the FDA's request.

2017-08-22,CYTK,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/handwriting-on-the-wall-suggests-progress-in-als-may-be-imminent-says-cytokinetics-ceo," 'Writing on the wall' suggests progress in ALS may be imminent, says Cytokinetics CEO","San Franciscan firm Cytokinetics (Nasdaq: CYTK) is pursuing an unusual angle to therapeutic discovery, starting from an understanding of the biology of muscles in order to explore treatment options in different disease areas.

This approach has seen the company develop a diverse pipeline of candidates, in heart failure, in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where lead candidate tirasemtiv is due to read out at Phase III later this year.

Launched 20 years ago, chief executive Robert Blum was with the firm from the start, leading in R&D and ultimately taking the tiller a few years after they went public in 2004.

Commenting on the company’s philosophy, Mr Blum points to: ""A pipeline that builds on one another, in terms of economies in drug discovery and synergies in drug development activities.""

Amgen collaboration in heart failure

As an example, he cites the company’s long-standing collaboration with fellow Californian biotech Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN), which he says has enabled investment in longer shots such as tirasemtiv.

""[Omecamtiv mecarbil] could ultimately be our most valuable program, and that has afforded us some advantages.""

""That's how we can make the commitment, take the risk, on tirasemtiv. Because we have partnered in other programs, most importantly omecamtiv mecarbil, with Amgen.”

“That could ultimately be our most valuable program, and that has afforded us some advantages. This candidate addresses a very large unmet need - high-risk heart failure patients who are recently hospitalized and therefore at high risk of death or readmission.”

“Heart failure is the largest cardiovascular market that is not well served by existing therapies. It's the number one reason why people over the age of 65 are hospitalized and the single largest line item in the pharmacotherapy budget for Medicare.”

Through its collaborations, Cytokinetics has been able to raise primarily non-diutive capital of over $500 million.

The economic potential in one program feeds into the rest of the company’s portfolio.

Mr Blum says: “As the drug went into Phase III it triggered milestone payments that enabled us to co-invest with Amgen to buy up our royalty economics.”

“We then sold a piece of those to generate additional capital, that we could invest in tirasemtiv.”

“I think this is most possible when you can organically build a pipeline by being the leader in one slice of biology. That affords these kinds of opportunities.""

Astellas collaboration in ALS

As well as Amgen, Cytokinetics is partnered with Japan’s Astellas Pharma (TYO: 4503), this time to develop treatments in neuromuscular indications.

While traditional approaches to ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, have sought to combat the condition from the perspective of nerve decay, Cytokinetics is looking at the disease through the prism of muscle biology, “remaining agnostic as to why the nerves may be degenerating.”

Mr Blum says: “We do know that the muscles are ultimately where the action is in the disease. Patients who live with ALS suffer a ruthless decline of muscle function, and typically die within three to four years, of respiratory failure and pneumonia.""

Cytokinetics believes its compound will be able to increase muscle force, empower and delay the time to muscle weakness and fatigue.

Recognizing the high burden of the disease and the high level of unmet need In ALS, Mr Blum says: “We knew that that could provide a very meaningful new opportunity to address the disease in ways unlike any other.""

The deal with Astellas was synergistic, as both companies are operating in the same research space. Mr Blum saw an advantage to combining their programs, as the company is: “making a major commitment to muscle biology, and employing different approaches that we thought to be quite complementary to ours.""

Cytokinetics has sold to Astellas an option on tirasemtiv, which would provide rights to co-develop and co-commercialize the drug outside of North America and Europe, where the American firm retains exclusivity.

Mr Blum says data from a large Phase III trial into the candidate will be presented at the annual International Symposium on ALS/MND, in Boston, in December.

“This is designed to confirm and extend findings from our earlier studies.”

""If the data are positive, we as a company are ready for regulatory filings in the US and Europe by mid-2018 to support our commercial activities. We're intending to commercialize this drug candidate ourselves in North America and Europe.""

Positive regulatory environment for ALS

Of particular interest in this therapeutic area is the recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of Radicava (edaravone), the first new drug in ALS for over two decades.

""The handwriting on the wall suggests that the division of neurology is accelerating review and approval of certain drugs for high unmet need.”

Unusually, the positive decision was the result of the FDA calling on the drugmaker, Japan’s Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma (TYO: 4508), to file for marketing authorization.

Asked whether this suggests a more positive approach toward expediting therapies, including for ALS, Mr Blum says: ""Yes, I think it probably does. The handwriting on the wall suggests that the division of neurology is accelerating review and approval of certain drugs for high unmet need.”

""What was noteworthy about the approval was that the trials seemed to be conflicting in terms of efficacy. I think the FDA was compelled by the fact that the drug appears to be safe, and they approved the drug subject to post-marketing conditions.""

""It's an important advance for the field, to be sure, but I think it will be interesting to see how it will be commercialized, and what the uptake will be.""

Under the stewardship of new FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, the FDA appears to be taking a more proactive approach, including hiring more staff, to bring innovative therapies to patients expeditiously.

Asked about progress at the FDA, Mr Blum says: ""From what I can see, things are moving forward very constructively. I think there's an opportunity for patients, caregivers, regulatory authorities, industry sponsors and everybody to align more on innovation, and create opportunities for new medicines that are truly innovative, to move forward swiftly.""
""I think the changes at the FDA underscore their commitment to the original intent of biopharmaceutical innovation, and that's the most encouraging sign coming out of Washington.""",L,4.42

2017-08-21,IRWD,https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Ironwood+Pharma+%28IRWD%29+Announces+FDA+Approval+of+DUZALLO+for+Treatment+of+Hyperuricemia+in+Patients+with+Uncontrolled+Gout/13222622.html,,"Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IRWD) today announced DUZALLO was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a once-daily oral treatment for hyperuricemia associated with gout in patients who have not achieved target serum uric acid (sUA) levels with a medically appropriate daily dose of allopurinol alone. DUZALLO is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Ironwood expects DUZALLO to be commercially available early in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Gout is a highly symptomatic and painful form of inflammatory arthritis caused by hyperuricemia, or elevated sUA levels in the blood, which can lead to painful flares and serious potential long-term health consequences.DUZALLO is the first drug that combines the current standard of care for the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout, allopurinol, with the most recent FDA-approved treatment for this condition, lesinurad. This fixed-dose combination provides a dual mechanism of action in a single tablet that can address both underlying causes of hyperuricemia – overproduction and underexcretion of serum uric acid.

“The approval of DUZALLO provides a new fixed-dose and dual-mechanism treatment option to help patients with uncontrolled gout achieve target serum uric acid levels. This represents an important and needed new option in the treatment of hyperuricemia,” said Michael A. Becker, M.D., professor emeritus of medicine, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL. “Gout is a serious and potentially progressive and debilitating inflammatory disease. Getting patients with gout to serum urate goal, and keeping them at or below goal, are essential to success in treating these patients. DUZALLO will help reduce the significant unmet need among patients in the U.S. who fail to get their serum uric acid levels to goal despite taking allopurinol alone.”

“With DUZALLO, nearly twice as many patients with uncontrolled gout may be able to achieve target serum uric acid levels compared to those patients taking allopurinol alone, which is important, considering the significant unmet need among uncontrolled gout patients to get to goal of under 6 mg/dL,” said Tom McCourt, senior vice president of marketing and sales and chief commercial officer at Ironwood. “We believe DUZALLO will be the critical driver behind Ironwood’s gout franchise, which is expected to exceed total annual U.S. peak sales of $300 million.”",L,2.65

DUZALLO is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia. The drug is expected to be commercially available early in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Gout, the most common inflammatory arthritis in adults, is a highly symptomatic and painful form of inflammatory arthritis caused by hyperuricemia - high serum uric acid (sUA) levels in the blood.

DUZALLO becomes the second gout drug in Ironwood's product portfolio. Last April, the Company acquired the exclusive U.S. rights to gout drug ZURAMPIC from AstraZeneca plc (AZN).

ZURAMPIC was approved by the FDA in December 2015 to be used in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI) for the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout. ZURAMPIC is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia and should not be used as monotherapy.

That is 16% of the entire national debt. As much as we blame the prices of new drugs for this gargantuan sum, one of the biggest chunks of it comes from diabetes, a disease whose treatment has not changed all that much since 1922. According to the American Diabetes Association, diabetes accounts for $322 billion in total U.S. health care spending as of 2016.

One Harvard study puts the annual cost at a much higher $822 billion annually. Whichever number you want to believe, it is among the costliest diseases in the world, for both patients and taxpayers. Thanks to Medicare and Medicaid, diabetes costs are socialized.



There are two reasons for the rising costs. First, the price of insulin has tripled since 2002. Second, the nature of lifetime treatment necessitates ever-rising doses of insulin as the disease progresses.

Short of hoping Americans radically change their diets overnight and drastically reduce sugar intake, the problem is not going away. But there is hope for significant cost reduction nonetheless. Here are three companies on the cutting edge of the newest diabetes advancements that, with some luck, may help reduce this nearly unfathomable cost to the U.S. economy and taxpayers.

Novo Nordisk and semaglutide

Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) recently announced its once-weekly GLP-1 agonist semaglutide handily beat Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide in terms of weight loss and blood sugar control in a pivotal Phase III trial. GLP-1 agonists, unlike insulin, stimulate pancreatic cells to produce insulin in a glucose-dependent manner. Meaning, GLP-1 agonists only induce native insulin production when blood glucose levels are high enough to trigger it. This is much more convenient than manually measuring blood sugar before injecting insulin directly.

While markets are focused on the one-on-one beat, raising Novo shares at the expense of Eli Lilly’s, there is potentially more exciting news regarding semaglutide yet to come. Novo Nordisk has already demonstrated in a Phase II trial that an oral formulation of semaglutide can work as well. If this continues into Phase III, the implication could be big for diabetes treatment costs. Oral formulations of otherwise intravenous drugs increase patient compliance and, if it works better than GLP-1 agonists currently on the market, it could keep diabetes patients healthier for longer, reducing long-run costs as the disease progresses, by far the costliest aspect of diabetes.

Roche and the artificial pancreas

Another innovative way to increase patient compliance and reduce long-run costs is to simply automate everything. Roche Holding AG (RHHBY) is currently sponsoring a late-stage development of an artificial pancreas that uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology together with an insulin pump to keep diabetics’ blood sugar in perpetual balance.

A pivotal Phase III trial was announced late last month, cosponsored by Roche Diabetics Care Inc. The ingenious closed-loop system uses a smartphone app to notify patients when blood sugar levels go out of range of preset limits. Since most of the damage from diabetes occurs when patients are out of their blood sugar target ranges, by keeping diabetics range-bound for longer, and hopefully perpetually, much of the cumulative damage from diabetes can hopefully be blunted or maybe even prevented for the long run. This closed-loop artificial pancreas is currently intended for Type 1 diabetics, though if successful it may be trialed for the much more prevalent Type 2 population.

Oramed and oral insulin

Perhaps the most ambitious of new diabetes treatments is an oral insulin formulation from Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ORMP). Oramed just recently announced a planned Phase III trial for what has been termed the holy grail of diabetes treatments.

Oral insulin could fundamentally change the entire diabetes playing field since it would change the way insulin interacts with blood glucose and make the process more akin to what occurs in healthy people. Oramed is using similar technology to what Novo Nordisk is using in its own oral GLP-1 treatment, so there is reason to believe it could actually work.

Oral insulin could get prediabetics on insulin earlier since injecting insulin daily is not only inconvenient but almost taboo and a last resort. Getting prediabetics on insulin faster could go a long way in reducing late-stage complications as the disease progresses and insulin resistance sets in.

There is reason to believe insulin resistance – the factor that necessitates ever-higher doses of insulin and where most of the costs lay - will be less of a problem with an oral formulation because oral insulin goes through the liver, which is the natural organ for regulating insulin release once it receives it from the pancreas. It is a way of having the body naturally regulate insulin release rather than having to measure the dose via blood sugar analysis constantly.

All or any success amongst these three companies could take a significant bite out of overall diabetes costs over the next decade and beyond. Diabetes is by far the costliest health care niche and badly in need of a major advance. With three companies with potentially paradigm-shifting treatments in the pipe, chances are we will see that major advance before the close of this decade and before diabetes costs spiral completely out of control, if they have not done so already.",L,3.12

2017-08-22,NVAX,,Novavax: The Case For Going Long,"Market confidence in Novavax evaporated in 2016 after the failure of an RSV vaccine trial in the elderly population; investors remain dubious about the prospects of the ongoing maternal trial.

Concerns over Novavax’s ability to finance itself to the end of the maternal vaccine trial without dilution have further dampened investor sentiment.

Evidence suggests the next RSV vaccine trial will not be a repetition of the 2016 failure, but will succeed in line with past Phase II trials.

With negativity depressing the share price, a buying opportunity has emerged.

Positive interim topline results in 2018, and other positive news from the pipeline, will move the share price upward over the next few quarters.

I'm like the man from Texas. You see, the man from Missouri always says, 'You've got to show me.' But the man from Texas says, 'You've got to put it in my hand.'"" —Jack London
Novavax (NASDAQ: NVAX) is a clinical-stage biotech company with an enviable pipeline, including a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a disease that afflicts millions of people around the world. Novavax's maternal RSV vaccine candidate is in the Phase III clinical trial stage. Novavax's work toward a viable RSV vaccine won the backing of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2015, including up to $89 million in grants to support the development and clinical trials of a maternal vaccine.

Novavax's story goes well beyond just one vaccine, with other prospective drugs in the pipeline, including vaccines for the Zika virus and Ebola, as well as a novel nanoparticle flu vaccine that utilizes the company's proprietary Matrix-M adjuvant.

This would all seem to add up to an exceptional story. Unfortunately, there is a very serious hitch: In September 2016, the Phase III clinical trial of Novavax's RSV vaccine for elderly patients, dubbed “Resolve”, laid an egg. The trial failed to meet both its primary and secondary endpoints. The market reacted as one would expect, with Novavax's share price taking a more than 83 percent dive overnight. Since then, the stock has slipped further and now trades around $1.00 per share. That is a far cry from the $8.34 per share posted the day the Resolve trial results were announced.",L,8.0

Getting prediabetics on insulin faster could go a long way in reducing late-stage complications as the disease progresses and insulin resistance sets in.

There is reason to believe insulin resistance – the factor that necessitates ever-higher doses of insulin and where most of the costs lay - will be less of a problem with an oral formulation because oral insulin goes through the liver, which is the natural organ for regulating insulin release once it receives it from the pancreas. It is a way of having the body naturally regulate insulin release rather than having to measure the dose via blood sugar analysis constantly.

All or any success amongst these three companies could take a significant bite out of overall diabetes costs over the next decade and beyond. Diabetes is by far the costliest health care niche and badly in need of a major advance.

Novo Nordisk and semaglutide

Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) recently announced its once-weekly GLP-1 agonist semaglutide handily beat Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide in terms of weight loss and blood sugar control in a pivotal Phase III trial. GLP-1 agonists, unlike insulin, stimulate pancreatic cells to produce insulin in a glucose-dependent manner. Meaning, GLP-1 agonists only induce native insulin production when blood glucose levels are high enough to trigger it. This is much more convenient than manually measuring blood sugar before injecting insulin directly.

While markets are focused on the one-on-one beat, raising Novo shares at the expense of Eli Lilly’s, there is potentially more exciting news regarding semaglutide yet to come. Novo Nordisk has already demonstrated in a Phase II trial that an oral formulation of semaglutide can work as well. If this continues into Phase III, the implication could be big for diabetes treatment costs. Oral formulations of otherwise intravenous drugs increase patient compliance and, if it works better than GLP-1 agonists currently on the market, it could keep diabetes patients healthier for longer, reducing long-run costs as the disease progresses, by far the costliest aspect of diabetes.

Roche and the artificial pancreas

Another innovative way to increase patient compliance and reduce long-run costs is to simply automate everything. Roche Holding AG (RHHBY) is currently sponsoring a late-stage development of an artificial pancreas that uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology together with an insulin pump to keep diabetics’ blood sugar in perpetual balance.

A pivotal Phase III trial was announced late last month, cosponsored by Roche Diabetics Care Inc. The ingenious closed-loop system uses a smartphone app to notify patients when blood sugar levels go out of range of preset limits. Since most of the damage from diabetes occurs when patients are out of their blood sugar target ranges, by keeping diabetics range-bound for longer, and hopefully perpetually, much of the cumulative damage from diabetes can hopefully be blunted or maybe even prevented for the long run. This closed-loop artificial pancreas is currently intended for Type 1 diabetics, though if successful it may be trialed for the much more prevalent Type 2 population.

Oramed and oral insulin

Perhaps the most ambitious of new diabetes treatments is an oral insulin formulation from Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ORMP). Oramed just recently announced a planned Phase III trial for what has been termed the holy grail of diabetes treatments.

Oral insulin could fundamentally change the entire diabetes playing field since it would change the way insulin interacts with blood glucose and make the process more akin to what occurs in healthy people.

About Recro Pharma, Inc.

Recro is a specialty pharmaceutical company that operates through two business divisions, an Acute Care, hospital product division and a revenue-generating contract development and manufacturing, or CDMO division, located at the Company's Gainesville facility. The Acute Care division is primarily focused on developing innovative products for hospital and other acute care settings. The Company's lead product candidate is a proprietary injectable form of meloxicam, a long-acting preferential COX-2 inhibitor. IV meloxicam 30mg has successfully completed two pivotal Phase III clinical efficacy trials in patients following bunionectomy and abdominoplasty surgeries, a large double blind Phase III safety trial, four Phase II clinical trials for the management of moderate to severe post-operative pain, as well as other safety studies. As injectable meloxicam is in the non-opioid class of drugs, the Company believes it will overcome many of the issues associated with commonly prescribed opioid therapeutics, including respiratory depression, constipation, excessive nausea and vomiting, as well as having no addictive potential while maintaining meaningful analgesic effects for relief of pain. The Company's CDMO division leverages its formulation expertise to develop and manufacture pharmaceutical products using its proprietary delivery technologies and other manufacturing services for commercial partners who commercialize or plan to commercialize these products. These collaborations can result in revenue streams including royalties, profit sharing, research and development and manufacturing fees, which support continued operations for its CDMO division and it contributes non-dilutive funding for the development and pre-commercialization activities of its Acute Care division.

2017-08-22,SHPG,,"Shire: At 52-Week Low, Long-Term Opportunity Appears Significant","Shire's share price has been languishing near 52-week lows for a little while now.

Despite valid concerns about the prospect of intense competition in its important hematology franchise, the business remains attractive.

New assets in ophthalmology and oncology are generating strong results already, and additional assets look set to continue the trend.

Baxalta deal is also going well, and the potential exit from neuroscience should consolidate its reputation as the rare disease specialist at a time when orphan drug growth is expected to grow rapidly.

Combined with a highly cash-generative and healthy business, Shire looks very attractive for long-term investors right now. Shire’s* (SHPG) share price recently hit a 52-week low in both its London- and NASDAQ-listed shares. Yet, I continue to struggle to precisely see why this should be the case. Its H1 2017 results showed a company which was doing well across its franchises except neuroscience in which continued destocking in the second quarter of the year pushed it into negative growth (Data source: Q2 2017 Results):  Yet, nothing immediately jumped out as being justification for continued weakness in its share price. After all, excluding the effects of destocking, even neuroscience had seen growth.

As we will see, however, Shire is certainly facing intense competition in some of its core areas. Yet, its success in fresh R&D results, combined with current and potential corporate level changes, suggests Shire is being undervalued right now. For long-term investors, today's somewhat subdued share price seems an ideal opportunity to buy into an increasingly compelling growth story coming from the world’s global leader in rare diseases.

A Hematology Hiatus Coming?

First off, we need to reflect a little on one of the main drivers of Shire’s share price weakness. Chiefly, this has surrounded increasing potential competition in some of its core franchises. This is especially true in its hematology franchise. Picked up as part of its Baxalta acquisition in 2016, it is now the largest revenue generator in the company. Yet, investors are getting a little nervous about potential threats in this area.

The subject has been more thoroughly explored by HealthBlogger last month. Shire has, however, a leading market position in the hematology market. Its ADVATE and ADYNOVATE are approved for use in the treatment of hemophilia without inhibitor (that is, for those patients who have not developed Factor VIII inhibitors). Indeed, ADVATE is the top Factor VIII brand with proven efficacy in the market. Similarly, for those who have developed Factor VIII inhibitors, Shire markets FEIBA which is an anti-inhibitor coagulant or bypassing agent. For Shire, this latter area contributes about 23% of total hematology revenue with the former contributing the lion’s share of the rest (Data source: Q2 2017 Results): However, competition is building. Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY) has seen its emicizumab (ACE910) drug perform well against its primary and all its secondary endpoints in its Phase III trial. As it explained:

The primary endpoint showed a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in treated bleeds of 87% (risk rate [RR]=0.13, p<0.0001) with emicizumab prophylaxis compared with on-demand (no prophylaxis; episodic use only) bypassing agents.
Although Shire and Roche are taking the battle of the treatments through the court, it is clear that should it reach the market (perhaps next year), it poses a sizeable threat to Feiba’s revenue. Shire’s CEO, Flemming Ornskov, argued that, despite reservations, ACE910 could result in hefty market share losses:

While we don't know for sure how much of our approximately $800 million in annual global sales of FEIBA is at risk, and this will most certainly be impacted by the potential approval timing, the final label and the future clinical and real-world data generated from patients, we do think that the market's current expectation for up to 50% share erosion after five years post-launch is reasonable. That said, we believe there will be no one-size-fits-all approach to treating these kinds of patients, and FEIBA will remain an important therapeutic option also in the future.
Roche is also in the process of releasing data on its Phase III trial pitching emicizumab into the hemophilia without inhibitors treatment. Naturally, should this readout be strong, this poses a threat to a far larger part of hematology revenue. Undoubtedly, as HealthBlogger highlighted:

The unmet need in this segment is much lower than in the inhibitor segment, because the factor VIII replacement therapy (i.e. ADVATE) is a high efficacious therapy for these patients, but if the drug will show a similar compelling profile also in this segment, it’s reasonable to assume that Shire will lose additional market share also in this therapeutic indication.
Roche is thus posing a looming and near-term threat to Shire’s strong position in the hematology market. Other competitors are also lining up to take a share of the spoils, however. BioMarin, for instance, has seen strong results from its Phase I/II trial of its BMN 270 gene therapy. Although it still needs to pass through the larger Phase III trial, some believe that BMN 270 could be on the market by 2019. This would undoubtedly put more pressure on Shire’s hematology revenue. With other pharma companies coming up with potential new drugs to take share from Shire’s already on-market drugs, investors are understandably a bit more aware of the potential frailty in its major revenue generator.

Nonetheless, Shire has not been standing still with its own pipeline in the hematology space. Its lanadelumab (SHP643) Phase III trial for heredity angioedema (NYSE:HAE) is showing early signs of strong promise in its primary and secondary endpoints. Shire may well be facing tougher competition in its core hemophilia market, yet its broader hematology franchise appears to be continuing its strong history of advances.

Lialda Laid Low?

Shire has also been facing a tough environment for its ulcerative colitis drug, LIALDA. The drug had become the star of its internal medicine franchise and contributed nearly 6% of total revenue in Q2 2017:

News that Zydus Cadila had been given approval by the FDA to release a generic of the drug, therefore, was hardly well received by investors. The arrival of the LIALDA generic was, as Shire’s CEO Flemming Ornskov noted, “a little earlier than [they] anticipated.”

As a result, this had driven down the revenue predictions for FY 2017 to between $14.3 billion and $14.6 billion (driven, as it explained, primarily by the generics arrival). Despite this, however, it remains the only generic on the market at present and as such Shire believes it can keep its market share fairly healthy. As Ornskov explained:

in a market with one generic competitor and, for the matter, even if there was a second, we think we can maintain a reasonable share of this market in the next few years.
Clearly, however, it will impact upon margins for the drug. What is more, it is hard to argue with Ornskov when he explained that “longer term, [maintaining market share] will become increasingly difficult.”

Although an unwelcome revenue shock, however, Shire remains well-placed in its internal medicine franchise. GATTEX, its drug for short bowel syndrome, saw its constant-currency revenue growth jump 70% in Q2 2017. With Shire directing its LIALDA sales teams to focus on GATTEX, we can expect to see continued strong growth in this drugs revenue contribution. Indeed, its performance should be strong enough to soften the blow coming from the revenue declines seen in the LIALDA business.

The threats to its hematological and LIALDA revenue are certainly something to watch, yet it is important to note that Shire has a great many opportunities facing it which investors have perhaps forgotten in the face of recent news flow.

Ophthalmology Opportunity

Ophthalmology is a new business area. It opened a unit back in May 2014 seeing an opportunity to do as it has done throughout its history: fill a research vacuum in rare and specialty diseases.

XIIDRA (picked up as part of their $160 million acquisition of SARcode in 2013) received approval in July 2016. It was the first drug to treat both the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. This gives it the edge on the established market drug, RESTASIS, already generated strong revenue for Allergan (AGN). XIIDRA also has another benefit over RESTASIS: it works faster.

Unsurprisingly, therefore, XIIDRA has already shown good revenue momentum. As Jeffrey Poulton, Shire’s CFO, noted:

We continue to be pleased with the performance of XIIDRA since launch. XIIDRA contributed $57 million in sales during the quarter, as prescription demand increased 13% from Q1, with market share increasing to approximately 23% by the end of Q2.
Indeed, it has already built up its market share rapidly since it was launched (Data source: Q1 2017 Results Presentation): Yet, here is the thing, this is a huge market share despite the fact that XIIDRA has not yet gained access to a large part of the DED market. As Poulton added at Q1 2017:

Importantly, this very impressive [market share] gain has been primarily driven by our ability to command share in the commercial insurance market, where XIIDRA has broad coverage. In the commercial market alone, our share is, of course, much higher than 22%. As you may know, we do not have broad Medicare coverage yet. I remain optimistic that we will be able to improve access to the Medicare population, who accounts for more than 40% of the current dry eye disease market.
Adding later that:

We’re building this [XIIDRA] brand into a blockbuster like we did with VYVANSE, step-by-step, keeping in mind we have patents until 2029 and expect few potential competitive entrants before XIIDRA’s patent expiry.
What is more, Shire has good pipeline prospects for building a more broad-based ophthalmology franchise. As well as additional DED developments, it has good trial progress in glaucoma and infectious conjunctivitis (Source: Shire Ophthalmology Pipeline in July 2017):",L,1.81

Regulatory approvals are anticipated in 2019.

My last report focused on ABO-102 for sanfilippo syndrome type A, which I believe may be worth $30 - $60/ share.  Recent clinical trial data continues to support that view.

This report focuses on EB-101, a gene therapy for Epidermolysis Bullosa, a rare skin disorder that inflicts terrible levels of morbidity and mortality.

If successfully commercialized, EB-101 could easily generate cashflows with NPV > $60/ share also.  I expect a small phase III confirmatory study to commence in 1Q18.

Some of New York's smartest healthcare investors joined the register in 4Q16 and newsflow continues to surprise on the upside.  There are multiple catalysts in the next 12 months.

Abeona - a ""String of Pearls"" Strategy with each Pearl Potentially Worth >$30/ share in NPV

Abeona (ABEO) is a small cap biotech company that I have written about in the past (see Abeona: Preparing For Liftoff - The Next AveXis?). In my opinion, this stock has the potential to be >$100/ share in 24-36 months, driven by the commercialization of five gene therapy products for rare diseases that currently have no available treatment options.

My last report, published in February, provided a detailed analysis of the company's initial gene therapy product, ABO-102, which is in clinical trials for San Filippo Syndrome Type A. This company uses an identical AAV9 vector to that employed by AveXis (AVXS) for their SMA gene therapy product. Initial data from the first six patients is extremely encouraging demonstrating a dose response in biomarkers (such as urinary GAG and CSF GAG) and suggestive evidence that the patients are experiencing a neurocognitive benefit. In fact, the clinical trial data presented during the past six months on this product really couldn't have been any better. You can read about this product in my initial report and see the initial clinical trial data in the company presentation. Without knowing pricing strategy or the outlook for reimbursement in my last report I suggested that future cash flows from this product alone likely have an NPV of $1.5bn - $3bn, equivalent to $30 - $60/share.",W,27.39

2017-08-21,BMY,https://www.mesotheliomahelp.org/2017/08/results-opdivo-trial-may-help-mesothelioma-oncologists-identify-patients-will-benefit-drug/,,"In April, MesotheliomaHelp reported on the findings of a phase I clinical trial showing that the five-year survival rate for some lung cancer patients treated with Opdivo (nivolumab), an immunotherapy treatment, was “much higher” than historical data. Now, researchers report that results from a phase III clinical trial may help oncologists determine those lung cancer patients, and possibly, mesothelioma patients, who will benefit from the immuno-oncology drug.

Opdivo, developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, works by blocking the PD-L1 protein and activating the immune system, leading it to attack and kill cancer cells. According to a June 21 press release from The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, a team of researchers led by David Carbone, MD, PhD, of The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer – Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute, found that although the trial did not improve progression-free survival when compared with chemotherapy in the overall population, those patients with a high expression of PD-L1 did benefit.

“The good news is that we discovered that a subset of patients who had both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status did experience a significant benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

Specifically, the researchers report that patients who had “both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status” realized a 75 percent response rate compared to just 16 percent response rate with low mutation burden and low PDL-1. However, the response rates for chemotherapy treatment in these same subsets were nearly the same leading the researchers to conclude that the PDL-1 markers “were selective for immunotherapy.”

Mesothelioma, a rare, asbestos-related cancer of the lining of the lungs, abdomen or heart, is highly aggressive and is resistant to many cancer treatments. The prognosis for mesothelioma patients is usually grim: the average survival time varies from 4 – 18 months after diagnosis. For the close to 3,000 Americans diagnosed with the disease each year, personalized care may bring a breakthrough treatment not previously considered by their physician.

The benefits of personalized care for mesothelioma patients have been proven where researchers have identified genetic biomarkers that reflect the aggressiveness of mesothelioma as well as markers that can assess the effectiveness of a particular treatment.

Opdivo is currently in a phase III clinical trial in the UK for mesothelioma patients. Known as The CheckpOiNt Blockade For Inhibition of Relapsed Mesothelioma, or CONIFRM, the trial has a goal of ‘exploiting the potential of immunotherapy.’

Keytruda, which gained popularity after saving former President Jimmy Carter’s life after sending his melanoma into remission, is also a PD-L1 inhibitor. Both immunotherapy drugs have shown in studies to be effective in fighting pleural mesothelioma. Keytruda is, perhaps, more well known due to eight-year mesothelioma survivor Mavis Nye of England, who went into remission after a two-year clinical trial of the drug.

“This study is an important step toward understanding the impact of tumor mutation burden and PDL-1 in immunotherapy response. This data shows we should evaluate these two factors independently to most accurately define who will benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

2017-08-22,CYTK,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/handwriting-on-the-wall-suggests-progress-in-als-may-be-imminent-says-cytokinetics-ceo," 'Writing on the wall' suggests progress in ALS may be imminent, says Cytokinetics CEO","San Franciscan firm Cytokinetics (Nasdaq: CYTK) is pursuing an unusual angle to therapeutic discovery, starting from an understanding of the biology of muscles in order to explore treatment options in different disease areas.

This approach has seen the company develop a diverse pipeline of candidates, in heart failure, in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where lead candidate tirasemtiv is due to read out at Phase III later this year.

Launched 20 years ago, chief executive Robert Blum was with the firm from the start, leading in R&D and ultimately taking the tiller a few years after they went public in 2004.

Commenting on the company’s philosophy, Mr Blum points to: ""A pipeline that builds on one another, in terms of economies in drug discovery and synergies in drug development activities.""

Amgen collaboration in heart failure

As an example, he cites the company’s long-standing collaboration with fellow Californian biotech Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN), which he says has enabled investment in longer shots such as tirasemtiv.

""[Omecamtiv mecarbil] could ultimately be our most valuable program, and that has afforded us some advantages.""

""That's how we can make the commitment, take the risk, on tirasemtiv. Because we have partnered in other programs, most importantly omecamtiv mecarbil, with Amgen.”

“That could ultimately be our most valuable program, and that has afforded us some advantages. This candidate addresses a very large unmet need - high-risk heart failure patients who are recently hospitalized and therefore at high risk of death or readmission.”

“Heart failure is the largest cardiovascular market that is not well served by existing therapies. It's the number one reason why people over the age of 65 are hospitalized and the single largest line item in the pharmacotherapy budget for Medicare.”

Through its collaborations, Cytokinetics has been able to raise primarily non-diutive capital of over $500 million.

The economic potential in one program feeds into the rest of the company’s portfolio.

Mr Blum says: “As the drug went into Phase III it triggered milestone payments that enabled us to co-invest with Amgen to buy up our royalty economics.”

“We then sold a piece of those to generate additional capital, that we could invest in tirasemtiv.”

“I think this is most possible when you can organically build a pipeline by being the leader in one slice of biology. That affords these kinds of opportunities.""

Astellas collaboration in ALS

As well as Amgen, Cytokinetics is partnered with Japan’s Astellas Pharma (TYO: 4503), this time to develop treatments in neuromuscular indications.

While traditional approaches to ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, have sought to combat the condition from the perspective of nerve decay, Cytokinetics is looking at the disease through the prism of muscle biology, “remaining agnostic as to why the nerves may be degenerating.”

Mr Blum says: “We do know that the muscles are ultimately where the action is in the disease. Patients who live with ALS suffer a ruthless decline of muscle function, and typically die within three to four years, of respiratory failure and pneumonia.""

Cytokinetics believes its compound will be able to increase muscle force, empower and delay the time to muscle weakness and fatigue.

Recognizing the high burden of the disease and the high level of unmet need In ALS, Mr Blum says: “We knew that that could provide a very meaningful new opportunity to address the disease in ways unlike any other.""

The deal with Astellas was synergistic, as both companies are operating in the same research space. Mr Blum saw an advantage to combining their programs, as the company is: “making a major commitment to muscle biology, and employing different approaches that we thought to be quite complementary to ours.""

Cytokinetics has sold to Astellas an option on tirasemtiv, which would provide rights to co-develop and co-commercialize the drug outside of North America and Europe, where the American firm retains exclusivity.

Mr Blum says data from a large Phase III trial into the candidate will be presented at the annual International Symposium on ALS/MND, in Boston, in December.

“This is designed to confirm and extend findings from our earlier studies.”

""If the data are positive, we as a company are ready for regulatory filings in the US and Europe by mid-2018 to support our commercial activities. We're intending to commercialize this drug candidate ourselves in North America and Europe.""

Positive regulatory environment for ALS

Of particular interest in this therapeutic area is the recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of Radicava (edaravone), the first new drug in ALS for over two decades.

""The handwriting on the wall suggests that the division of neurology is accelerating review and approval of certain drugs for high unmet need.”

Unusually, the positive decision was the result of the FDA calling on the drugmaker, Japan’s Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma (TYO: 4508), to file for marketing authorization.

Asked whether this suggests a more positive approach toward expediting therapies, including for ALS, Mr Blum says: ""Yes, I think it probably does. The handwriting on the wall suggests that the division of neurology is accelerating review and approval of certain drugs for high unmet need.”

""What was noteworthy about the approval was that the trials seemed to be conflicting in terms of efficacy. I think the FDA was compelled by the fact that the drug appears to be safe, and they approved the drug subject to post-marketing conditions.""

""It's an important advance for the field, to be sure, but I think it will be interesting to see how it will be commercialized, and what the uptake will be.""

Under the stewardship of new FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, the FDA appears to be taking a more proactive approach, including hiring more staff, to bring innovative therapies to patients expeditiously.

Asked about progress at the FDA, Mr Blum says: ""From what I can see, things are moving forward very constructively. I think there's an opportunity for patients, caregivers, regulatory authorities, industry sponsors and everybody to align more on innovation, and create opportunities for new medicines that are truly innovative, to move forward swiftly.""
""I think the changes at the FDA underscore their commitment to the original intent of biopharmaceutical innovation, and that's the most encouraging sign coming out of Washington.""",L,4.42

2017-08-21,IRWD,https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Ironwood+Pharma+%28IRWD%29+Announces+FDA+Approval+of+DUZALLO+for+Treatment+of+Hyperuricemia+in+Patients+with+Uncontrolled+Gout/13222622.html,,"Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IRWD) today announced DUZALLO was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a once-daily oral treatment for hyperuricemia associated with gout in patients who have not achieved target serum uric acid (sUA) levels with a medically appropriate daily dose of allopurinol alone. DUZALLO is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Ironwood expects DUZALLO to be commercially available early in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Gout is a highly symptomatic and painful form of inflammatory arthritis caused by hyperuricemia, or elevated sUA levels in the blood, which can lead to painful flares and serious potential long-term health consequences.DUZALLO is the first drug that combines the current standard of care for the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout, allopurinol, with the most recent FDA-approved treatment for this condition, lesinurad. This fixed-dose combination provides a dual mechanism of action in a single tablet that can address both underlying causes of hyperuricemia – overproduction and underexcretion of serum uric acid.

“The approval of DUZALLO provides a new fixed-dose and dual-mechanism treatment option to help patients with uncontrolled gout achieve target serum uric acid levels. This represents an important and needed new option in the treatment of hyperuricemia,” said Michael A. Becker, M.D., professor emeritus of medicine, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL. “Gout is a serious and potentially progressive and debilitating inflammatory disease. Getting patients with gout to serum urate goal, and keeping them at or below goal, are essential to success in treating these patients. DUZALLO will help reduce the significant unmet need among patients in the U.S. who fail to get their serum uric acid levels to goal despite taking allopurinol alone.”

“With DUZALLO, nearly twice as many patients with uncontrolled gout may be able to achieve target serum uric acid levels compared to those patients taking allopurinol alone, which is important, considering the significant unmet need among uncontrolled gout patients to get to goal of under 6 mg/dL,” said Tom McCourt, senior vice president of marketing and sales and chief commercial officer at Ironwood. “We believe DUZALLO will be the critical driver behind Ironwood’s gout franchise, which is expected to exceed total annual U.S. peak sales of $300 million.”",L,2.65

Novo Nordisk and semaglutide

Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) recently announced its once-weekly GLP-1 agonist semaglutide handily beat Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide in terms of weight loss and blood sugar control in a pivotal Phase III trial. GLP-1 agonists, unlike insulin, stimulate pancreatic cells to produce insulin in a glucose-dependent manner. Meaning, GLP-1 agonists only induce native insulin production when blood glucose levels are high enough to trigger it. This is much more convenient than manually measuring blood sugar before injecting insulin directly.

While markets are focused on the one-on-one beat, raising Novo shares at the expense of Eli Lilly’s, there is potentially more exciting news regarding semaglutide yet to come. Novo Nordisk has already demonstrated in a Phase II trial that an oral formulation of semaglutide can work as well. If this continues into Phase III, the implication could be big for diabetes treatment costs. Oral formulations of otherwise intravenous drugs increase patient compliance and, if it works better than GLP-1 agonists currently on the market, it could keep diabetes patients healthier for longer, reducing long-run costs as the disease progresses, by far the costliest aspect of diabetes.

Roche and the artificial pancreas

Another innovative way to increase patient compliance and reduce long-run costs is to simply automate everything. Roche Holding AG (RHHBY) is currently sponsoring a late-stage development of an artificial pancreas that uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology together with an insulin pump to keep diabetics’ blood sugar in perpetual balance.

A pivotal Phase III trial was announced late last month, cosponsored by Roche Diabetics Care Inc. The ingenious closed-loop system uses a smartphone app to notify patients when blood sugar levels go out of range of preset limits. Since most of the damage from diabetes occurs when patients are out of their blood sugar target ranges, by keeping diabetics range-bound for longer, and hopefully perpetually, much of the cumulative damage from diabetes can hopefully be blunted or maybe even prevented for the long run. This closed-loop artificial pancreas is currently intended for Type 1 diabetics, though if successful it may be trialed for the much more prevalent Type 2 population.

Oramed and oral insulin

Perhaps the most ambitious of new diabetes treatments is an oral insulin formulation from Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ORMP). Oramed just recently announced a planned Phase III trial for what has been termed the holy grail of diabetes treatments.

Oral insulin could fundamentally change the entire diabetes playing field since it would change the way insulin interacts with blood glucose and make the process more akin to what occurs in healthy people. Oramed is using similar technology to what Novo Nordisk is using in its own oral GLP-1 treatment, so there is reason to believe it could actually work.

Oral insulin could get prediabetics on insulin earlier since injecting insulin daily is not only inconvenient but almost taboo and a last resort. Getting prediabetics on insulin faster could go a long way in reducing late-stage complications as the disease progresses and insulin resistance sets in.

There is reason to believe insulin resistance – the factor that necessitates ever-higher doses of insulin and where most of the costs lay - will be less of a problem with an oral formulation because oral insulin goes through the liver, which is the natural organ for regulating insulin release once it receives it from the pancreas. It is a way of having the body naturally regulate insulin release rather than having to measure the dose via blood sugar analysis constantly.

All or any success amongst these three companies could take a significant bite out of overall diabetes costs over the next decade and beyond. Diabetes is by far the costliest health care niche and badly in need of a major advance. With three companies with potentially paradigm-shifting treatments in the pipe, chances are we will see that major advance before the close of this decade and before diabetes costs spiral completely out of control, if they have not done so already.",L,3.12

2017-08-22,NVAX,,Novavax: The Case For Going Long,"Market confidence in Novavax evaporated in 2016 after the failure of an RSV vaccine trial in the elderly population; investors remain dubious about the prospects of the ongoing maternal trial.

Concerns over Novavax’s ability to finance itself to the end of the maternal vaccine trial without dilution have further dampened investor sentiment.

Evidence suggests the next RSV vaccine trial will not be a repetition of the 2016 failure, but will succeed in line with past Phase II trials.

With negativity depressing the share price, a buying opportunity has emerged.

Positive interim topline results in 2018, and other positive news from the pipeline, will move the share price upward over the next few quarters.

I'm like the man from Texas. You see, the man from Missouri always says, 'You've got to show me.' But the man from Texas says, 'You've got to put it in my hand.'"" —Jack London
Novavax (NASDAQ: NVAX) is a clinical-stage biotech company with an enviable pipeline, including a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a disease that afflicts millions of people around the world. Novavax's maternal RSV vaccine candidate is in the Phase III clinical trial stage. Novavax's work toward a viable RSV vaccine won the backing of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2015, including up to $89 million in grants to support the development and clinical trials of a maternal vaccine.

Novavax's story goes well beyond just one vaccine, with other prospective drugs in the pipeline, including vaccines for the Zika virus and Ebola, as well as a novel nanoparticle flu vaccine that utilizes the company's proprietary Matrix-M adjuvant.

This would all seem to add up to an exceptional story. Unfortunately, there is a very serious hitch: In September 2016, the Phase III clinical trial of Novavax's RSV vaccine for elderly patients, dubbed “Resolve”, laid an egg. The trial failed to meet both its primary and secondary endpoints. The market reacted as one would expect, with Novavax's share price taking a more than 83 percent dive overnight. Since then, the stock has slipped further and now trades around $1.00 per share. That is a far cry from the $8.34 per share posted the day the Resolve trial results were announced.",L,8.0

About Recro Pharma, Inc.

Recro is a specialty pharmaceutical company that operates through two business divisions, an Acute Care, hospital product division and a revenue-generating contract development and manufacturing, or CDMO division, located at the Company's Gainesville facility. The Acute Care division is primarily focused on developing innovative products for hospital and other acute care settings. The Company's lead product candidate is a proprietary injectable form of meloxicam, a long-acting preferential COX-2 inhibitor. IV meloxicam 30mg has successfully completed two pivotal Phase III clinical efficacy trials in patients following bunionectomy and abdominoplasty surgeries, a large double blind Phase III safety trial, four Phase II clinical trials for the management of moderate to severe post-operative pain, as well as other safety studies. As injectable meloxicam is in the non-opioid class of drugs, the Company believes it will overcome many of the issues associated with commonly prescribed opioid therapeutics, including respiratory depression, constipation, excessive nausea and vomiting, as well as having no addictive potential while maintaining meaningful analgesic effects for relief of pain. The Company's CDMO division leverages its formulation expertise to develop and manufacture pharmaceutical products using its proprietary delivery technologies and other manufacturing services for commercial partners who commercialize or plan to commercialize these products. These collaborations can result in revenue streams including royalties, profit sharing, research and development and manufacturing fees, which support continued operations for its CDMO division and it contributes non-dilutive funding for the development and pre-commercialization activities of its Acute Care division.

Meaning, GLP-1 agonists only induce native insulin production when blood glucose levels are high enough to trigger it. This is much more convenient than manually measuring blood sugar before injecting insulin directly.

While markets are focused on the one-on-one beat, raising Novo shares at the expense of Eli Lilly’s, there is potentially more exciting news regarding semaglutide yet to come. Novo Nordisk has already demonstrated in a Phase II trial that an oral formulation of semaglutide can work as well. If this continues into Phase III, the implication could be big for diabetes treatment costs. Oral formulations of otherwise intravenous drugs increase patient compliance and, if it works better than GLP-1 agonists currently on the market, it could keep diabetes patients healthier for longer, reducing long-run costs as the disease progresses, by far the costliest aspect of diabetes.

Roche and the artificial pancreas

Another innovative way to increase patient compliance and reduce long-run costs is to simply automate everything. Roche Holding AG (RHHBY) is currently sponsoring a late-stage development of an artificial pancreas that uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology together with an insulin pump to keep diabetics’ blood sugar in perpetual balance.

A pivotal Phase III trial was announced late last month, cosponsored by Roche Diabetics Care Inc. The ingenious closed-loop system uses a smartphone app to notify patients when blood sugar levels go out of range of preset limits. Since most of the damage from diabetes occurs when patients are out of their blood sugar target ranges, by keeping diabetics range-bound for longer, and hopefully perpetually, much of the cumulative damage from diabetes can hopefully be blunted or maybe even prevented for the long run. This closed-loop artificial pancreas is currently intended for Type 1 diabetics, though if successful it may be trialed for the much more prevalent Type 2 population.

Oramed and oral insulin

Perhaps the most ambitious of new diabetes treatments is an oral insulin formulation from Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ORMP). Oramed just recently announced a planned Phase III trial for what has been termed the holy grail of diabetes treatments.

Oral insulin could fundamentally change the entire diabetes playing field since it would change the way insulin interacts with blood glucose and make the process more akin to what occurs in healthy people. Oramed is using similar technology to what Novo Nordisk is using in its own oral GLP-1 treatment, so there is reason to believe it could actually work.

Oral insulin could get prediabetics on insulin earlier since injecting insulin daily is not only inconvenient but almost taboo and a last resort. Getting prediabetics on insulin faster could go a long way in reducing late-stage complications as the disease progresses and insulin resistance sets in.

There is reason to believe insulin resistance – the factor that necessitates ever-higher doses of insulin and where most of the costs lay - will be less of a problem with an oral formulation because oral insulin goes through the liver, which is the natural organ for regulating insulin release once it receives it from the pancreas. It is a way of having the body naturally regulate insulin release rather than having to measure the dose via blood sugar analysis constantly.

All or any success amongst these three companies could take a significant bite out of overall diabetes costs over the next decade and beyond. Diabetes is by far the costliest health care niche and badly in need of a major advance. With three companies with potentially paradigm-shifting treatments in the pipe, chances are we will see that major advance before the close of this decade and before diabetes costs spiral completely out of control, if they have not done so already.",L,1.05

2017-08-22,SHPG,,"Shire: At 52-Week Low, Long-Term Opportunity Appears Significant","Shire's share price has been languishing near 52-week lows for a little while now.

Despite valid concerns about the prospect of intense competition in its important hematology franchise, the business remains attractive.

New assets in ophthalmology and oncology are generating strong results already, and additional assets look set to continue the trend.

Baxalta deal is also going well, and the potential exit from neuroscience should consolidate its reputation as the rare disease specialist at a time when orphan drug growth is expected to grow rapidly.

Combined with a highly cash-generative and healthy business, Shire looks very attractive for long-term investors right now. Shire’s* (SHPG) share price recently hit a 52-week low in both its London- and NASDAQ-listed shares. Yet, I continue to struggle to precisely see why this should be the case. Its H1 2017 results showed a company which was doing well across its franchises except neuroscience in which continued destocking in the second quarter of the year pushed it into negative growth (Data source: Q2 2017 Results):  Yet, nothing immediately jumped out as being justification for continued weakness in its share price. After all, excluding the effects of destocking, even neuroscience had seen growth.

As we will see, however, Shire is certainly facing intense competition in some of its core areas. Yet, its success in fresh R&D results, combined with current and potential corporate level changes, suggests Shire is being undervalued right now. For long-term investors, today's somewhat subdued share price seems an ideal opportunity to buy into an increasingly compelling growth story coming from the world’s global leader in rare diseases.

A Hematology Hiatus Coming?

First off, we need to reflect a little on one of the main drivers of Shire’s share price weakness. Chiefly, this has surrounded increasing potential competition in some of its core franchises. This is especially true in its hematology franchise. Picked up as part of its Baxalta acquisition in 2016, it is now the largest revenue generator in the company. Yet, investors are getting a little nervous about potential threats in this area.

The subject has been more thoroughly explored by HealthBlogger last month. Shire has, however, a leading market position in the hematology market. Its ADVATE and ADYNOVATE are approved for use in the treatment of hemophilia without inhibitor (that is, for those patients who have not developed Factor VIII inhibitors). Indeed, ADVATE is the top Factor VIII brand with proven efficacy in the market. Similarly, for those who have developed Factor VIII inhibitors, Shire markets FEIBA which is an anti-inhibitor coagulant or bypassing agent. For Shire, this latter area contributes about 23% of total hematology revenue with the former contributing the lion’s share of the rest (Data source: Q2 2017 Results): However, competition is building. Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY) has seen its emicizumab (ACE910) drug perform well against its primary and all its secondary endpoints in its Phase III trial. As it explained:

The primary endpoint showed a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in treated bleeds of 87% (risk rate [RR]=0.13, p<0.0001) with emicizumab prophylaxis compared with on-demand (no prophylaxis; episodic use only) bypassing agents.
Although Shire and Roche are taking the battle of the treatments through the court, it is clear that should it reach the market (perhaps next year), it poses a sizeable threat to Feiba’s revenue. Shire’s CEO, Flemming Ornskov, argued that, despite reservations, ACE910 could result in hefty market share losses:

While we don't know for sure how much of our approximately $800 million in annual global sales of FEIBA is at risk, and this will most certainly be impacted by the potential approval timing, the final label and the future clinical and real-world data generated from patients, we do think that the market's current expectation for up to 50% share erosion after five years post-launch is reasonable. That said, we believe there will be no one-size-fits-all approach to treating these kinds of patients, and FEIBA will remain an important therapeutic option also in the future.
Roche is also in the process of releasing data on its Phase III trial pitching emicizumab into the hemophilia without inhibitors treatment. Naturally, should this readout be strong, this poses a threat to a far larger part of hematology revenue. Undoubtedly, as HealthBlogger highlighted:

The unmet need in this segment is much lower than in the inhibitor segment, because the factor VIII replacement therapy (i.e. ADVATE) is a high efficacious therapy for these patients, but if the drug will show a similar compelling profile also in this segment, it’s reasonable to assume that Shire will lose additional market share also in this therapeutic indication.
Roche is thus posing a looming and near-term threat to Shire’s strong position in the hematology market. Other competitors are also lining up to take a share of the spoils, however. BioMarin, for instance, has seen strong results from its Phase I/II trial of its BMN 270 gene therapy. Although it still needs to pass through the larger Phase III trial, some believe that BMN 270 could be on the market by 2019. This would undoubtedly put more pressure on Shire’s hematology revenue. With other pharma companies coming up with potential new drugs to take share from Shire’s already on-market drugs, investors are understandably a bit more aware of the potential frailty in its major revenue generator.

Nonetheless, Shire has not been standing still with its own pipeline in the hematology space. Its lanadelumab (SHP643) Phase III trial for heredity angioedema (NYSE:HAE) is showing early signs of strong promise in its primary and secondary endpoints. Shire may well be facing tougher competition in its core hemophilia market, yet its broader hematology franchise appears to be continuing its strong history of advances.

Lialda Laid Low?

Shire has also been facing a tough environment for its ulcerative colitis drug, LIALDA. The drug had become the star of its internal medicine franchise and contributed nearly 6% of total revenue in Q2 2017:

News that Zydus Cadila had been given approval by the FDA to release a generic of the drug, therefore, was hardly well received by investors. The arrival of the LIALDA generic was, as Shire’s CEO Flemming Ornskov noted, “a little earlier than [they] anticipated.”

As a result, this had driven down the revenue predictions for FY 2017 to between $14.3 billion and $14.6 billion (driven, as it explained, primarily by the generics arrival). Despite this, however, it remains the only generic on the market at present and as such Shire believes it can keep its market share fairly healthy. As Ornskov explained:

in a market with one generic competitor and, for the matter, even if there was a second, we think we can maintain a reasonable share of this market in the next few years.
Clearly, however, it will impact upon margins for the drug. What is more, it is hard to argue with Ornskov when he explained that “longer term, [maintaining market share] will become increasingly difficult.”

Although an unwelcome revenue shock, however, Shire remains well-placed in its internal medicine franchise. GATTEX, its drug for short bowel syndrome, saw its constant-currency revenue growth jump 70% in Q2 2017. With Shire directing its LIALDA sales teams to focus on GATTEX, we can expect to see continued strong growth in this drugs revenue contribution. Indeed, its performance should be strong enough to soften the blow coming from the revenue declines seen in the LIALDA business.

The threats to its hematological and LIALDA revenue are certainly something to watch, yet it is important to note that Shire has a great many opportunities facing it which investors have perhaps forgotten in the face of recent news flow.

Ophthalmology Opportunity

Ophthalmology is a new business area. It opened a unit back in May 2014 seeing an opportunity to do as it has done throughout its history: fill a research vacuum in rare and specialty diseases.

XIIDRA (picked up as part of their $160 million acquisition of SARcode in 2013) received approval in July 2016. It was the first drug to treat both the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. This gives it the edge on the established market drug, RESTASIS, already generated strong revenue for Allergan (AGN). XIIDRA also has another benefit over RESTASIS: it works faster.

Unsurprisingly, therefore, XIIDRA has already shown good revenue momentum. As Jeffrey Poulton, Shire’s CFO, noted:

We continue to be pleased with the performance of XIIDRA since launch. XIIDRA contributed $57 million in sales during the quarter, as prescription demand increased 13% from Q1, with market share increasing to approximately 23% by the end of Q2.
Indeed, it has already built up its market share rapidly since it was launched (Data source: Q1 2017 Results Presentation): Yet, here is the thing, this is a huge market share despite the fact that XIIDRA has not yet gained access to a large part of the DED market. As Poulton added at Q1 2017:

Importantly, this very impressive [market share] gain has been primarily driven by our ability to command share in the commercial insurance market, where XIIDRA has broad coverage. In the commercial market alone, our share is, of course, much higher than 22%. As you may know, we do not have broad Medicare coverage yet. I remain optimistic that we will be able to improve access to the Medicare population, who accounts for more than 40% of the current dry eye disease market.
Adding later that:

We’re building this [XIIDRA] brand into a blockbuster like we did with VYVANSE, step-by-step, keeping in mind we have patents until 2029 and expect few potential competitive entrants before XIIDRA’s patent expiry.
What is more, Shire has good pipeline prospects for building a more broad-based ophthalmology franchise. As well as additional DED developments, it has good trial progress in glaucoma and infectious conjunctivitis (Source: Shire Ophthalmology Pipeline in July 2017):",L,1.81

Now, researchers report that results from a phase III clinical trial may help oncologists determine those lung cancer patients, and possibly, mesothelioma patients, who will benefit from the immuno-oncology drug.

Opdivo, developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, works by blocking the PD-L1 protein and activating the immune system, leading it to attack and kill cancer cells. According to a June 21 press release from The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, a team of researchers led by David Carbone, MD, PhD, of The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer – Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute, found that although the trial did not improve progression-free survival when compared with chemotherapy in the overall population, those patients with a high expression of PD-L1 did benefit.

“The good news is that we discovered that a subset of patients who had both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status did experience a significant benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

Specifically, the researchers report that patients who had “both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status” realized a 75 percent response rate compared to just 16 percent response rate with low mutation burden and low PDL-1. However, the response rates for chemotherapy treatment in these same subsets were nearly the same leading the researchers to conclude that the PDL-1 markers “were selective for immunotherapy.”

Mesothelioma, a rare, asbestos-related cancer of the lining of the lungs, abdomen or heart, is highly aggressive and is resistant to many cancer treatments. The prognosis for mesothelioma patients is usually grim: the average survival time varies from 4 – 18 months after diagnosis. For the close to 3,000 Americans diagnosed with the disease each year, personalized care may bring a breakthrough treatment not previously considered by their physician.

The benefits of personalized care for mesothelioma patients have been proven where researchers have identified genetic biomarkers that reflect the aggressiveness of mesothelioma as well as markers that can assess the effectiveness of a particular treatment.

Opdivo is currently in a phase III clinical trial in the UK for mesothelioma patients. Known as The CheckpOiNt Blockade For Inhibition of Relapsed Mesothelioma, or CONIFRM, the trial has a goal of ‘exploiting the potential of immunotherapy.’

Keytruda, which gained popularity after saving former President Jimmy Carter’s life after sending his melanoma into remission, is also a PD-L1 inhibitor. Both immunotherapy drugs have shown in studies to be effective in fighting pleural mesothelioma. Keytruda is, perhaps, more well known due to eight-year mesothelioma survivor Mavis Nye of England, who went into remission after a two-year clinical trial of the drug.

“This study is an important step toward understanding the impact of tumor mutation burden and PDL-1 in immunotherapy response. This data shows we should evaluate these two factors independently to most accurately define who will benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

(CRME) (COM.TO) plunged more than 32% on Monday as the FDA is not satisfied with the data package proposed by the Company to support the resubmission of its Brinavess New Drug Application.

Brinavess is used to rapidly restore normal heart rhythm in adult patients (aged 18 years or over) who have recently started having atrial fibrillation.

In its most recent communication with the FDA, the Company proposed resubmission of the NDA based upon the original file and six years of accumulated safety data from sales of BRINAVESS in thirty-three countries, augmented by interim results from over 1,100 patients enrolled in the SPECTRUM study, a prospective post-authorization European Union safety study, along with pre-clinical data from subsequent studies the Company completed at the FDA's request.

2017-08-22,CYTK,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/handwriting-on-the-wall-suggests-progress-in-als-may-be-imminent-says-cytokinetics-ceo," 'Writing on the wall' suggests progress in ALS may be imminent, says Cytokinetics CEO","San Franciscan firm Cytokinetics (Nasdaq: CYTK) is pursuing an unusual angle to therapeutic discovery, starting from an understanding of the biology of muscles in order to explore treatment options in different disease areas.

This approach has seen the company develop a diverse pipeline of candidates, in heart failure, in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where lead candidate tirasemtiv is due to read out at Phase III later this year.

Launched 20 years ago, chief executive Robert Blum was with the firm from the start, leading in R&D and ultimately taking the tiller a few years after they went public in 2004.

Commenting on the company’s philosophy, Mr Blum points to: ""A pipeline that builds on one another, in terms of economies in drug discovery and synergies in drug development activities.""

Amgen collaboration in heart failure

As an example, he cites the company’s long-standing collaboration with fellow Californian biotech Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN), which he says has enabled investment in longer shots such as tirasemtiv.

""[Omecamtiv mecarbil] could ultimately be our most valuable program, and that has afforded us some advantages.""

""That's how we can make the commitment, take the risk, on tirasemtiv. Because we have partnered in other programs, most importantly omecamtiv mecarbil, with Amgen.”

“That could ultimately be our most valuable program, and that has afforded us some advantages. This candidate addresses a very large unmet need - high-risk heart failure patients who are recently hospitalized and therefore at high risk of death or readmission.”

“Heart failure is the largest cardiovascular market that is not well served by existing therapies. It's the number one reason why people over the age of 65 are hospitalized and the single largest line item in the pharmacotherapy budget for Medicare.”

Through its collaborations, Cytokinetics has been able to raise primarily non-diutive capital of over $500 million.

The economic potential in one program feeds into the rest of the company’s portfolio.

Mr Blum says: “As the drug went into Phase III it triggered milestone payments that enabled us to co-invest with Amgen to buy up our royalty economics.”

“We then sold a piece of those to generate additional capital, that we could invest in tirasemtiv.”

“I think this is most possible when you can organically build a pipeline by being the leader in one slice of biology. That affords these kinds of opportunities.""

Astellas collaboration in ALS

As well as Amgen, Cytokinetics is partnered with Japan’s Astellas Pharma (TYO: 4503), this time to develop treatments in neuromuscular indications.

While traditional approaches to ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, have sought to combat the condition from the perspective of nerve decay, Cytokinetics is looking at the disease through the prism of muscle biology, “remaining agnostic as to why the nerves may be degenerating.”

Mr Blum says: “We do know that the muscles are ultimately where the action is in the disease. Patients who live with ALS suffer a ruthless decline of muscle function, and typically die within three to four years, of respiratory failure and pneumonia.""

Cytokinetics believes its compound will be able to increase muscle force, empower and delay the time to muscle weakness and fatigue.

Recognizing the high burden of the disease and the high level of unmet need In ALS, Mr Blum says: “We knew that that could provide a very meaningful new opportunity to address the disease in ways unlike any other.""

The deal with Astellas was synergistic, as both companies are operating in the same research space. Mr Blum saw an advantage to combining their programs, as the company is: “making a major commitment to muscle biology, and employing different approaches that we thought to be quite complementary to ours.""

Cytokinetics has sold to Astellas an option on tirasemtiv, which would provide rights to co-develop and co-commercialize the drug outside of North America and Europe, where the American firm retains exclusivity.

Mr Blum says data from a large Phase III trial into the candidate will be presented at the annual International Symposium on ALS/MND, in Boston, in December.

“This is designed to confirm and extend findings from our earlier studies.”

""If the data are positive, we as a company are ready for regulatory filings in the US and Europe by mid-2018 to support our commercial activities. We're intending to commercialize this drug candidate ourselves in North America and Europe.""

Positive regulatory environment for ALS

Of particular interest in this therapeutic area is the recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of Radicava (edaravone), the first new drug in ALS for over two decades.

""The handwriting on the wall suggests that the division of neurology is accelerating review and approval of certain drugs for high unmet need.”

Unusually, the positive decision was the result of the FDA calling on the drugmaker, Japan’s Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma (TYO: 4508), to file for marketing authorization.

Asked whether this suggests a more positive approach toward expediting therapies, including for ALS, Mr Blum says: ""Yes, I think it probably does. The handwriting on the wall suggests that the division of neurology is accelerating review and approval of certain drugs for high unmet need.”

""What was noteworthy about the approval was that the trials seemed to be conflicting in terms of efficacy. I think the FDA was compelled by the fact that the drug appears to be safe, and they approved the drug subject to post-marketing conditions.""

""It's an important advance for the field, to be sure, but I think it will be interesting to see how it will be commercialized, and what the uptake will be.""

Under the stewardship of new FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, the FDA appears to be taking a more proactive approach, including hiring more staff, to bring innovative therapies to patients expeditiously.

Asked about progress at the FDA, Mr Blum says: ""From what I can see, things are moving forward very constructively. I think there's an opportunity for patients, caregivers, regulatory authorities, industry sponsors and everybody to align more on innovation, and create opportunities for new medicines that are truly innovative, to move forward swiftly.""
""I think the changes at the FDA underscore their commitment to the original intent of biopharmaceutical innovation, and that's the most encouraging sign coming out of Washington.""",L,4.42

2017-08-21,IRWD,https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Ironwood+Pharma+%28IRWD%29+Announces+FDA+Approval+of+DUZALLO+for+Treatment+of+Hyperuricemia+in+Patients+with+Uncontrolled+Gout/13222622.html,,"Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IRWD) today announced DUZALLO was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a once-daily oral treatment for hyperuricemia associated with gout in patients who have not achieved target serum uric acid (sUA) levels with a medically appropriate daily dose of allopurinol alone. DUZALLO is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Ironwood expects DUZALLO to be commercially available early in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Gout is a highly symptomatic and painful form of inflammatory arthritis caused by hyperuricemia, or elevated sUA levels in the blood, which can lead to painful flares and serious potential long-term health consequences.DUZALLO is the first drug that combines the current standard of care for the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout, allopurinol, with the most recent FDA-approved treatment for this condition, lesinurad. This fixed-dose combination provides a dual mechanism of action in a single tablet that can address both underlying causes of hyperuricemia – overproduction and underexcretion of serum uric acid.

“The approval of DUZALLO provides a new fixed-dose and dual-mechanism treatment option to help patients with uncontrolled gout achieve target serum uric acid levels. This represents an important and needed new option in the treatment of hyperuricemia,” said Michael A. Becker, M.D., professor emeritus of medicine, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL. “Gout is a serious and potentially progressive and debilitating inflammatory disease. Getting patients with gout to serum urate goal, and keeping them at or below goal, are essential to success in treating these patients. DUZALLO will help reduce the significant unmet need among patients in the U.S. who fail to get their serum uric acid levels to goal despite taking allopurinol alone.”

“With DUZALLO, nearly twice as many patients with uncontrolled gout may be able to achieve target serum uric acid levels compared to those patients taking allopurinol alone, which is important, considering the significant unmet need among uncontrolled gout patients to get to goal of under 6 mg/dL,” said Tom McCourt, senior vice president of marketing and sales and chief commercial officer at Ironwood. “We believe DUZALLO will be the critical driver behind Ironwood’s gout franchise, which is expected to exceed total annual U.S. peak sales of $300 million.”",L,2.65

DUZALLO is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia. The drug is expected to be commercially available early in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Gout, the most common inflammatory arthritis in adults, is a highly symptomatic and painful form of inflammatory arthritis caused by hyperuricemia - high serum uric acid (sUA) levels in the blood.

DUZALLO becomes the second gout drug in Ironwood's product portfolio. Last April, the Company acquired the exclusive U.S. rights to gout drug ZURAMPIC from AstraZeneca plc (AZN).

ZURAMPIC was approved by the FDA in December 2015 to be used in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI) for the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout. ZURAMPIC is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia and should not be used as monotherapy.

That is 16% of the entire national debt. As much as we blame the prices of new drugs for this gargantuan sum, one of the biggest chunks of it comes from diabetes, a disease whose treatment has not changed all that much since 1922. According to the American Diabetes Association, diabetes accounts for $322 billion in total U.S. health care spending as of 2016.

One Harvard study puts the annual cost at a much higher $822 billion annually. Whichever number you want to believe, it is among the costliest diseases in the world, for both patients and taxpayers. Thanks to Medicare and Medicaid, diabetes costs are socialized.



There are two reasons for the rising costs. First, the price of insulin has tripled since 2002. Second, the nature of lifetime treatment necessitates ever-rising doses of insulin as the disease progresses.

Short of hoping Americans radically change their diets overnight and drastically reduce sugar intake, the problem is not going away. But there is hope for significant cost reduction nonetheless. Here are three companies on the cutting edge of the newest diabetes advancements that, with some luck, may help reduce this nearly unfathomable cost to the U.S. economy and taxpayers.

Novo Nordisk and semaglutide

Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) recently announced its once-weekly GLP-1 agonist semaglutide handily beat Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide in terms of weight loss and blood sugar control in a pivotal Phase III trial. GLP-1 agonists, unlike insulin, stimulate pancreatic cells to produce insulin in a glucose-dependent manner. Meaning, GLP-1 agonists only induce native insulin production when blood glucose levels are high enough to trigger it. This is much more convenient than manually measuring blood sugar before injecting insulin directly.

While markets are focused on the one-on-one beat, raising Novo shares at the expense of Eli Lilly’s, there is potentially more exciting news regarding semaglutide yet to come. Novo Nordisk has already demonstrated in a Phase II trial that an oral formulation of semaglutide can work as well. If this continues into Phase III, the implication could be big for diabetes treatment costs. Oral formulations of otherwise intravenous drugs increase patient compliance and, if it works better than GLP-1 agonists currently on the market, it could keep diabetes patients healthier for longer, reducing long-run costs as the disease progresses, by far the costliest aspect of diabetes.

Roche and the artificial pancreas

Another innovative way to increase patient compliance and reduce long-run costs is to simply automate everything. Roche Holding AG (RHHBY) is currently sponsoring a late-stage development of an artificial pancreas that uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology together with an insulin pump to keep diabetics’ blood sugar in perpetual balance.

A pivotal Phase III trial was announced late last month, cosponsored by Roche Diabetics Care Inc. The ingenious closed-loop system uses a smartphone app to notify patients when blood sugar levels go out of range of preset limits. Since most of the damage from diabetes occurs when patients are out of their blood sugar target ranges, by keeping diabetics range-bound for longer, and hopefully perpetually, much of the cumulative damage from diabetes can hopefully be blunted or maybe even prevented for the long run. This closed-loop artificial pancreas is currently intended for Type 1 diabetics, though if successful it may be trialed for the much more prevalent Type 2 population.

Oramed and oral insulin

Perhaps the most ambitious of new diabetes treatments is an oral insulin formulation from Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ORMP). Oramed just recently announced a planned Phase III trial for what has been termed the holy grail of diabetes treatments.

Oral insulin could fundamentally change the entire diabetes playing field since it would change the way insulin interacts with blood glucose and make the process more akin to what occurs in healthy people. Oramed is using similar technology to what Novo Nordisk is using in its own oral GLP-1 treatment, so there is reason to believe it could actually work.

Oral insulin could get prediabetics on insulin earlier since injecting insulin daily is not only inconvenient but almost taboo and a last resort. Getting prediabetics on insulin faster could go a long way in reducing late-stage complications as the disease progresses and insulin resistance sets in.

There is reason to believe insulin resistance – the factor that necessitates ever-higher doses of insulin and where most of the costs lay - will be less of a problem with an oral formulation because oral insulin goes through the liver, which is the natural organ for regulating insulin release once it receives it from the pancreas. It is a way of having the body naturally regulate insulin release rather than having to measure the dose via blood sugar analysis constantly.

All or any success amongst these three companies could take a significant bite out of overall diabetes costs over the next decade and beyond. Diabetes is by far the costliest health care niche and badly in need of a major advance. With three companies with potentially paradigm-shifting treatments in the pipe, chances are we will see that major advance before the close of this decade and before diabetes costs spiral completely out of control, if they have not done so already.",L,3.12

2017-08-22,NVAX,,Novavax: The Case For Going Long,"Market confidence in Novavax evaporated in 2016 after the failure of an RSV vaccine trial in the elderly population; investors remain dubious about the prospects of the ongoing maternal trial.

Concerns over Novavax’s ability to finance itself to the end of the maternal vaccine trial without dilution have further dampened investor sentiment.

Evidence suggests the next RSV vaccine trial will not be a repetition of the 2016 failure, but will succeed in line with past Phase II trials.

With negativity depressing the share price, a buying opportunity has emerged.

Positive interim topline results in 2018, and other positive news from the pipeline, will move the share price upward over the next few quarters.

I'm like the man from Texas. You see, the man from Missouri always says, 'You've got to show me.' But the man from Texas says, 'You've got to put it in my hand.'"" —Jack London
Novavax (NASDAQ: NVAX) is a clinical-stage biotech company with an enviable pipeline, including a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a disease that afflicts millions of people around the world. Novavax's maternal RSV vaccine candidate is in the Phase III clinical trial stage. Novavax's work toward a viable RSV vaccine won the backing of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2015, including up to $89 million in grants to support the development and clinical trials of a maternal vaccine.

Novavax's story goes well beyond just one vaccine, with other prospective drugs in the pipeline, including vaccines for the Zika virus and Ebola, as well as a novel nanoparticle flu vaccine that utilizes the company's proprietary Matrix-M adjuvant.

This would all seem to add up to an exceptional story. Unfortunately, there is a very serious hitch: In September 2016, the Phase III clinical trial of Novavax's RSV vaccine for elderly patients, dubbed “Resolve”, laid an egg. The trial failed to meet both its primary and secondary endpoints. The market reacted as one would expect, with Novavax's share price taking a more than 83 percent dive overnight. Since then, the stock has slipped further and now trades around $1.00 per share. That is a far cry from the $8.34 per share posted the day the Resolve trial results were announced.",L,8.0

Novo Nordisk and semaglutide

Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) recently announced its once-weekly GLP-1 agonist semaglutide handily beat Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide in terms of weight loss and blood sugar control in a pivotal Phase III trial. GLP-1 agonists, unlike insulin, stimulate pancreatic cells to produce insulin in a glucose-dependent manner. Meaning, GLP-1 agonists only induce native insulin production when blood glucose levels are high enough to trigger it. This is much more convenient than manually measuring blood sugar before injecting insulin directly.

While markets are focused on the one-on-one beat, raising Novo shares at the expense of Eli Lilly’s, there is potentially more exciting news regarding semaglutide yet to come. Novo Nordisk has already demonstrated in a Phase II trial that an oral formulation of semaglutide can work as well. If this continues into Phase III, the implication could be big for diabetes treatment costs. Oral formulations of otherwise intravenous drugs increase patient compliance and, if it works better than GLP-1 agonists currently on the market, it could keep diabetes patients healthier for longer, reducing long-run costs as the disease progresses, by far the costliest aspect of diabetes.

Roche and the artificial pancreas

Another innovative way to increase patient compliance and reduce long-run costs is to simply automate everything. Roche Holding AG (RHHBY) is currently sponsoring a late-stage development of an artificial pancreas that uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology together with an insulin pump to keep diabetics’ blood sugar in perpetual balance.

A pivotal Phase III trial was announced late last month, cosponsored by Roche Diabetics Care Inc. The ingenious closed-loop system uses a smartphone app to notify patients when blood sugar levels go out of range of preset limits. Since most of the damage from diabetes occurs when patients are out of their blood sugar target ranges, by keeping diabetics range-bound for longer, and hopefully perpetually, much of the cumulative damage from diabetes can hopefully be blunted or maybe even prevented for the long run. This closed-loop artificial pancreas is currently intended for Type 1 diabetics, though if successful it may be trialed for the much more prevalent Type 2 population.

Oramed and oral insulin

Perhaps the most ambitious of new diabetes treatments is an oral insulin formulation from Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ORMP). Oramed just recently announced a planned Phase III trial for what has been termed the holy grail of diabetes treatments.

Oral insulin could fundamentally change the entire diabetes playing field since it would change the way insulin interacts with blood glucose and make the process more akin to what occurs in healthy people. Oramed is using similar technology to what Novo Nordisk is using in its own oral GLP-1 treatment, so there is reason to believe it could actually work.

Oral insulin could get prediabetics on insulin earlier since injecting insulin daily is not only inconvenient but almost taboo and a last resort. Getting prediabetics on insulin faster could go a long way in reducing late-stage complications as the disease progresses and insulin resistance sets in.

There is reason to believe insulin resistance – the factor that necessitates ever-higher doses of insulin and where most of the costs lay - will be less of a problem with an oral formulation because oral insulin goes through the liver, which is the natural organ for regulating insulin release once it receives it from the pancreas. It is a way of having the body naturally regulate insulin release rather than having to measure the dose via blood sugar analysis constantly.

All or any success amongst these three companies could take a significant bite out of overall diabetes costs over the next decade and beyond. Diabetes is by far the costliest health care niche and badly in need of a major advance. With three companies with potentially paradigm-shifting treatments in the pipe, chances are we will see that major advance before the close of this decade and before diabetes costs spiral completely out of control, if they have not done so already.",L,2.1

About Recro Pharma, Inc.

Recro is a specialty pharmaceutical company that operates through two business divisions, an Acute Care, hospital product division and a revenue-generating contract development and manufacturing, or CDMO division, located at the Company's Gainesville facility. The Acute Care division is primarily focused on developing innovative products for hospital and other acute care settings. The Company's lead product candidate is a proprietary injectable form of meloxicam, a long-acting preferential COX-2 inhibitor. IV meloxicam 30mg has successfully completed two pivotal Phase III clinical efficacy trials in patients following bunionectomy and abdominoplasty surgeries, a large double blind Phase III safety trial, four Phase II clinical trials for the management of moderate to severe post-operative pain, as well as other safety studies. As injectable meloxicam is in the non-opioid class of drugs, the Company believes it will overcome many of the issues associated with commonly prescribed opioid therapeutics, including respiratory depression, constipation, excessive nausea and vomiting, as well as having no addictive potential while maintaining meaningful analgesic effects for relief of pain. The Company's CDMO division leverages its formulation expertise to develop and manufacture pharmaceutical products using its proprietary delivery technologies and other manufacturing services for commercial partners who commercialize or plan to commercialize these products. These collaborations can result in revenue streams including royalties, profit sharing, research and development and manufacturing fees, which support continued operations for its CDMO division and it contributes non-dilutive funding for the development and pre-commercialization activities of its Acute Care division.

2017-08-22,SHPG,,"Shire: At 52-Week Low, Long-Term Opportunity Appears Significant","Shire's share price has been languishing near 52-week lows for a little while now.

Despite valid concerns about the prospect of intense competition in its important hematology franchise, the business remains attractive.

New assets in ophthalmology and oncology are generating strong results already, and additional assets look set to continue the trend.

Baxalta deal is also going well, and the potential exit from neuroscience should consolidate its reputation as the rare disease specialist at a time when orphan drug growth is expected to grow rapidly.

Combined with a highly cash-generative and healthy business, Shire looks very attractive for long-term investors right now. Shire’s* (SHPG) share price recently hit a 52-week low in both its London- and NASDAQ-listed shares. Yet, I continue to struggle to precisely see why this should be the case. Its H1 2017 results showed a company which was doing well across its franchises except neuroscience in which continued destocking in the second quarter of the year pushed it into negative growth (Data source: Q2 2017 Results):  Yet, nothing immediately jumped out as being justification for continued weakness in its share price. After all, excluding the effects of destocking, even neuroscience had seen growth.

As we will see, however, Shire is certainly facing intense competition in some of its core areas. Yet, its success in fresh R&D results, combined with current and potential corporate level changes, suggests Shire is being undervalued right now. For long-term investors, today's somewhat subdued share price seems an ideal opportunity to buy into an increasingly compelling growth story coming from the world’s global leader in rare diseases.

A Hematology Hiatus Coming?

First off, we need to reflect a little on one of the main drivers of Shire’s share price weakness. Chiefly, this has surrounded increasing potential competition in some of its core franchises. This is especially true in its hematology franchise. Picked up as part of its Baxalta acquisition in 2016, it is now the largest revenue generator in the company. Yet, investors are getting a little nervous about potential threats in this area.

The subject has been more thoroughly explored by HealthBlogger last month. Shire has, however, a leading market position in the hematology market. Its ADVATE and ADYNOVATE are approved for use in the treatment of hemophilia without inhibitor (that is, for those patients who have not developed Factor VIII inhibitors). Indeed, ADVATE is the top Factor VIII brand with proven efficacy in the market. Similarly, for those who have developed Factor VIII inhibitors, Shire markets FEIBA which is an anti-inhibitor coagulant or bypassing agent. For Shire, this latter area contributes about 23% of total hematology revenue with the former contributing the lion’s share of the rest (Data source: Q2 2017 Results): However, competition is building. Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY) has seen its emicizumab (ACE910) drug perform well against its primary and all its secondary endpoints in its Phase III trial. As it explained:

The primary endpoint showed a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in treated bleeds of 87% (risk rate [RR]=0.13, p<0.0001) with emicizumab prophylaxis compared with on-demand (no prophylaxis; episodic use only) bypassing agents.
Although Shire and Roche are taking the battle of the treatments through the court, it is clear that should it reach the market (perhaps next year), it poses a sizeable threat to Feiba’s revenue. Shire’s CEO, Flemming Ornskov, argued that, despite reservations, ACE910 could result in hefty market share losses:

While we don't know for sure how much of our approximately $800 million in annual global sales of FEIBA is at risk, and this will most certainly be impacted by the potential approval timing, the final label and the future clinical and real-world data generated from patients, we do think that the market's current expectation for up to 50% share erosion after five years post-launch is reasonable. That said, we believe there will be no one-size-fits-all approach to treating these kinds of patients, and FEIBA will remain an important therapeutic option also in the future.
Roche is also in the process of releasing data on its Phase III trial pitching emicizumab into the hemophilia without inhibitors treatment. Naturally, should this readout be strong, this poses a threat to a far larger part of hematology revenue. Undoubtedly, as HealthBlogger highlighted:

The unmet need in this segment is much lower than in the inhibitor segment, because the factor VIII replacement therapy (i.e. ADVATE) is a high efficacious therapy for these patients, but if the drug will show a similar compelling profile also in this segment, it’s reasonable to assume that Shire will lose additional market share also in this therapeutic indication.
Roche is thus posing a looming and near-term threat to Shire’s strong position in the hematology market. Other competitors are also lining up to take a share of the spoils, however. BioMarin, for instance, has seen strong results from its Phase I/II trial of its BMN 270 gene therapy. Although it still needs to pass through the larger Phase III trial, some believe that BMN 270 could be on the market by 2019. This would undoubtedly put more pressure on Shire’s hematology revenue. With other pharma companies coming up with potential new drugs to take share from Shire’s already on-market drugs, investors are understandably a bit more aware of the potential frailty in its major revenue generator.

Nonetheless, Shire has not been standing still with its own pipeline in the hematology space. Its lanadelumab (SHP643) Phase III trial for heredity angioedema (NYSE:HAE) is showing early signs of strong promise in its primary and secondary endpoints. Shire may well be facing tougher competition in its core hemophilia market, yet its broader hematology franchise appears to be continuing its strong history of advances.

Lialda Laid Low?

Shire has also been facing a tough environment for its ulcerative colitis drug, LIALDA. The drug had become the star of its internal medicine franchise and contributed nearly 6% of total revenue in Q2 2017:

News that Zydus Cadila had been given approval by the FDA to release a generic of the drug, therefore, was hardly well received by investors. The arrival of the LIALDA generic was, as Shire’s CEO Flemming Ornskov noted, “a little earlier than [they] anticipated.”

As a result, this had driven down the revenue predictions for FY 2017 to between $14.3 billion and $14.6 billion (driven, as it explained, primarily by the generics arrival). Despite this, however, it remains the only generic on the market at present and as such Shire believes it can keep its market share fairly healthy. As Ornskov explained:

in a market with one generic competitor and, for the matter, even if there was a second, we think we can maintain a reasonable share of this market in the next few years.
Clearly, however, it will impact upon margins for the drug. What is more, it is hard to argue with Ornskov when he explained that “longer term, [maintaining market share] will become increasingly difficult.”

Although an unwelcome revenue shock, however, Shire remains well-placed in its internal medicine franchise. GATTEX, its drug for short bowel syndrome, saw its constant-currency revenue growth jump 70% in Q2 2017. With Shire directing its LIALDA sales teams to focus on GATTEX, we can expect to see continued strong growth in this drugs revenue contribution. Indeed, its performance should be strong enough to soften the blow coming from the revenue declines seen in the LIALDA business.

The threats to its hematological and LIALDA revenue are certainly something to watch, yet it is important to note that Shire has a great many opportunities facing it which investors have perhaps forgotten in the face of recent news flow.

Ophthalmology Opportunity

Ophthalmology is a new business area. It opened a unit back in May 2014 seeing an opportunity to do as it has done throughout its history: fill a research vacuum in rare and specialty diseases.

XIIDRA (picked up as part of their $160 million acquisition of SARcode in 2013) received approval in July 2016. It was the first drug to treat both the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. This gives it the edge on the established market drug, RESTASIS, already generated strong revenue for Allergan (AGN). XIIDRA also has another benefit over RESTASIS: it works faster.

Unsurprisingly, therefore, XIIDRA has already shown good revenue momentum. As Jeffrey Poulton, Shire’s CFO, noted:

We continue to be pleased with the performance of XIIDRA since launch. XIIDRA contributed $57 million in sales during the quarter, as prescription demand increased 13% from Q1, with market share increasing to approximately 23% by the end of Q2.
Indeed, it has already built up its market share rapidly since it was launched (Data source: Q1 2017 Results Presentation): Yet, here is the thing, this is a huge market share despite the fact that XIIDRA has not yet gained access to a large part of the DED market. As Poulton added at Q1 2017:

Importantly, this very impressive [market share] gain has been primarily driven by our ability to command share in the commercial insurance market, where XIIDRA has broad coverage. In the commercial market alone, our share is, of course, much higher than 22%. As you may know, we do not have broad Medicare coverage yet. I remain optimistic that we will be able to improve access to the Medicare population, who accounts for more than 40% of the current dry eye disease market.
Adding later that:

We’re building this [XIIDRA] brand into a blockbuster like we did with VYVANSE, step-by-step, keeping in mind we have patents until 2029 and expect few potential competitive entrants before XIIDRA’s patent expiry.
What is more, Shire has good pipeline prospects for building a more broad-based ophthalmology franchise. As well as additional DED developments, it has good trial progress in glaucoma and infectious conjunctivitis (Source: Shire Ophthalmology Pipeline in July 2017):",L,1.81

Abeona (ABEO) is a small cap biotech company that I have written about in the past (see Abeona: Preparing For Liftoff - The Next AveXis?). In my opinion, this stock has the potential to be >$100/ share in 24-36 months, driven by the commercialization of five gene therapy products for rare diseases that currently have no available treatment options.

My last report, published in February, provided a detailed analysis of the company's initial gene therapy product, ABO-102, which is in clinical trials for San Filippo Syndrome Type A. This company uses an identical AAV9 vector to that employed by AveXis (AVXS) for their SMA gene therapy product. Initial data from the first six patients is extremely encouraging demonstrating a dose response in biomarkers (such as urinary GAG and CSF GAG) and suggestive evidence that the patients are experiencing a neurocognitive benefit. In fact, the clinical trial data presented during the past six months on this product really couldn't have been any better. You can read about this product in my initial report and see the initial clinical trial data in the company presentation. Without knowing pricing strategy or the outlook for reimbursement in my last report I suggested that future cash flows from this product alone likely have an NPV of $1.5bn - $3bn, equivalent to $30 - $60/share.",W,27.39

2017-08-21,BMY,https://www.mesotheliomahelp.org/2017/08/results-opdivo-trial-may-help-mesothelioma-oncologists-identify-patients-will-benefit-drug/,,"In April, MesotheliomaHelp reported on the findings of a phase I clinical trial showing that the five-year survival rate for some lung cancer patients treated with Opdivo (nivolumab), an immunotherapy treatment, was “much higher” than historical data. Now, researchers report that results from a phase III clinical trial may help oncologists determine those lung cancer patients, and possibly, mesothelioma patients, who will benefit from the immuno-oncology drug.

Opdivo, developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, works by blocking the PD-L1 protein and activating the immune system, leading it to attack and kill cancer cells. According to a June 21 press release from The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, a team of researchers led by David Carbone, MD, PhD, of The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer – Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute, found that although the trial did not improve progression-free survival when compared with chemotherapy in the overall population, those patients with a high expression of PD-L1 did benefit.

“The good news is that we discovered that a subset of patients who had both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status did experience a significant benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

Specifically, the researchers report that patients who had “both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status” realized a 75 percent response rate compared to just 16 percent response rate with low mutation burden and low PDL-1. However, the response rates for chemotherapy treatment in these same subsets were nearly the same leading the researchers to conclude that the PDL-1 markers “were selective for immunotherapy.”

Mesothelioma, a rare, asbestos-related cancer of the lining of the lungs, abdomen or heart, is highly aggressive and is resistant to many cancer treatments. The prognosis for mesothelioma patients is usually grim: the average survival time varies from 4 – 18 months after diagnosis. For the close to 3,000 Americans diagnosed with the disease each year, personalized care may bring a breakthrough treatment not previously considered by their physician.

The benefits of personalized care for mesothelioma patients have been proven where researchers have identified genetic biomarkers that reflect the aggressiveness of mesothelioma as well as markers that can assess the effectiveness of a particular treatment.

Opdivo is currently in a phase III clinical trial in the UK for mesothelioma patients. Known as The CheckpOiNt Blockade For Inhibition of Relapsed Mesothelioma, or CONIFRM, the trial has a goal of ‘exploiting the potential of immunotherapy.’

Keytruda, which gained popularity after saving former President Jimmy Carter’s life after sending his melanoma into remission, is also a PD-L1 inhibitor. Both immunotherapy drugs have shown in studies to be effective in fighting pleural mesothelioma. Keytruda is, perhaps, more well known due to eight-year mesothelioma survivor Mavis Nye of England, who went into remission after a two-year clinical trial of the drug.

“This study is an important step toward understanding the impact of tumor mutation burden and PDL-1 in immunotherapy response. This data shows we should evaluate these two factors independently to most accurately define who will benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

2017-08-22,CYTK,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/handwriting-on-the-wall-suggests-progress-in-als-may-be-imminent-says-cytokinetics-ceo," 'Writing on the wall' suggests progress in ALS may be imminent, says Cytokinetics CEO","San Franciscan firm Cytokinetics (Nasdaq: CYTK) is pursuing an unusual angle to therapeutic discovery, starting from an understanding of the biology of muscles in order to explore treatment options in different disease areas.

This approach has seen the company develop a diverse pipeline of candidates, in heart failure, in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where lead candidate tirasemtiv is due to read out at Phase III later this year.

Launched 20 years ago, chief executive Robert Blum was with the firm from the start, leading in R&D and ultimately taking the tiller a few years after they went public in 2004.

Commenting on the company’s philosophy, Mr Blum points to: ""A pipeline that builds on one another, in terms of economies in drug discovery and synergies in drug development activities.""

Amgen collaboration in heart failure

As an example, he cites the company’s long-standing collaboration with fellow Californian biotech Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN), which he says has enabled investment in longer shots such as tirasemtiv.

""[Omecamtiv mecarbil] could ultimately be our most valuable program, and that has afforded us some advantages.""

""That's how we can make the commitment, take the risk, on tirasemtiv. Because we have partnered in other programs, most importantly omecamtiv mecarbil, with Amgen.”

“That could ultimately be our most valuable program, and that has afforded us some advantages. This candidate addresses a very large unmet need - high-risk heart failure patients who are recently hospitalized and therefore at high risk of death or readmission.”

“Heart failure is the largest cardiovascular market that is not well served by existing therapies. It's the number one reason why people over the age of 65 are hospitalized and the single largest line item in the pharmacotherapy budget for Medicare.”

Through its collaborations, Cytokinetics has been able to raise primarily non-diutive capital of over $500 million.

The economic potential in one program feeds into the rest of the company’s portfolio.

Mr Blum says: “As the drug went into Phase III it triggered milestone payments that enabled us to co-invest with Amgen to buy up our royalty economics.”

“We then sold a piece of those to generate additional capital, that we could invest in tirasemtiv.”

“I think this is most possible when you can organically build a pipeline by being the leader in one slice of biology. That affords these kinds of opportunities.""

Astellas collaboration in ALS

As well as Amgen, Cytokinetics is partnered with Japan’s Astellas Pharma (TYO: 4503), this time to develop treatments in neuromuscular indications.

While traditional approaches to ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, have sought to combat the condition from the perspective of nerve decay, Cytokinetics is looking at the disease through the prism of muscle biology, “remaining agnostic as to why the nerves may be degenerating.”

Mr Blum says: “We do know that the muscles are ultimately where the action is in the disease. Patients who live with ALS suffer a ruthless decline of muscle function, and typically die within three to four years, of respiratory failure and pneumonia.""

Cytokinetics believes its compound will be able to increase muscle force, empower and delay the time to muscle weakness and fatigue.

Recognizing the high burden of the disease and the high level of unmet need In ALS, Mr Blum says: “We knew that that could provide a very meaningful new opportunity to address the disease in ways unlike any other.""

The deal with Astellas was synergistic, as both companies are operating in the same research space. Mr Blum saw an advantage to combining their programs, as the company is: “making a major commitment to muscle biology, and employing different approaches that we thought to be quite complementary to ours.""

Cytokinetics has sold to Astellas an option on tirasemtiv, which would provide rights to co-develop and co-commercialize the drug outside of North America and Europe, where the American firm retains exclusivity.

Mr Blum says data from a large Phase III trial into the candidate will be presented at the annual International Symposium on ALS/MND, in Boston, in December.

“This is designed to confirm and extend findings from our earlier studies.”

""If the data are positive, we as a company are ready for regulatory filings in the US and Europe by mid-2018 to support our commercial activities. We're intending to commercialize this drug candidate ourselves in North America and Europe.""

Positive regulatory environment for ALS

Of particular interest in this therapeutic area is the recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of Radicava (edaravone), the first new drug in ALS for over two decades.

""The handwriting on the wall suggests that the division of neurology is accelerating review and approval of certain drugs for high unmet need.”

Unusually, the positive decision was the result of the FDA calling on the drugmaker, Japan’s Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma (TYO: 4508), to file for marketing authorization.

Asked whether this suggests a more positive approach toward expediting therapies, including for ALS, Mr Blum says: ""Yes, I think it probably does. The handwriting on the wall suggests that the division of neurology is accelerating review and approval of certain drugs for high unmet need.”

""What was noteworthy about the approval was that the trials seemed to be conflicting in terms of efficacy. I think the FDA was compelled by the fact that the drug appears to be safe, and they approved the drug subject to post-marketing conditions.""

""It's an important advance for the field, to be sure, but I think it will be interesting to see how it will be commercialized, and what the uptake will be.""

Under the stewardship of new FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, the FDA appears to be taking a more proactive approach, including hiring more staff, to bring innovative therapies to patients expeditiously.

Asked about progress at the FDA, Mr Blum says: ""From what I can see, things are moving forward very constructively. I think there's an opportunity for patients, caregivers, regulatory authorities, industry sponsors and everybody to align more on innovation, and create opportunities for new medicines that are truly innovative, to move forward swiftly.""
""I think the changes at the FDA underscore their commitment to the original intent of biopharmaceutical innovation, and that's the most encouraging sign coming out of Washington.""",L,4.42

(NASDAQ: IRWD) today announced DUZALLO was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a once-daily oral treatment for hyperuricemia associated with gout in patients who have not achieved target serum uric acid (sUA) levels with a medically appropriate daily dose of allopurinol alone. DUZALLO is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Ironwood expects DUZALLO to be commercially available early in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Gout is a highly symptomatic and painful form of inflammatory arthritis caused by hyperuricemia, or elevated sUA levels in the blood, which can lead to painful flares and serious potential long-term health consequences.DUZALLO is the first drug that combines the current standard of care for the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout, allopurinol, with the most recent FDA-approved treatment for this condition, lesinurad. This fixed-dose combination provides a dual mechanism of action in a single tablet that can address both underlying causes of hyperuricemia – overproduction and underexcretion of serum uric acid.

“The approval of DUZALLO provides a new fixed-dose and dual-mechanism treatment option to help patients with uncontrolled gout achieve target serum uric acid levels. This represents an important and needed new option in the treatment of hyperuricemia,” said Michael A. Becker, M.D., professor emeritus of medicine, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL. “Gout is a serious and potentially progressive and debilitating inflammatory disease. Getting patients with gout to serum urate goal, and keeping them at or below goal, are essential to success in treating these patients. DUZALLO will help reduce the significant unmet need among patients in the U.S. who fail to get their serum uric acid levels to goal despite taking allopurinol alone.”

“With DUZALLO, nearly twice as many patients with uncontrolled gout may be able to achieve target serum uric acid levels compared to those patients taking allopurinol alone, which is important, considering the significant unmet need among uncontrolled gout patients to get to goal of under 6 mg/dL,” said Tom McCourt, senior vice president of marketing and sales and chief commercial officer at Ironwood. “We believe DUZALLO will be the critical driver behind Ironwood’s gout franchise, which is expected to exceed total annual U.S. peak sales of $300 million.”",L,2.65

Gout, the most common inflammatory arthritis in adults, is a highly symptomatic and painful form of inflammatory arthritis caused by hyperuricemia - high serum uric acid (sUA) levels in the blood.

DUZALLO becomes the second gout drug in Ironwood's product portfolio. Last April, the Company acquired the exclusive U.S. rights to gout drug ZURAMPIC from AstraZeneca plc (AZN).

Novo Nordisk and semaglutide

Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) recently announced its once-weekly GLP-1 agonist semaglutide handily beat Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide in terms of weight loss and blood sugar control in a pivotal Phase III trial. GLP-1 agonists, unlike insulin, stimulate pancreatic cells to produce insulin in a glucose-dependent manner. Meaning, GLP-1 agonists only induce native insulin production when blood glucose levels are high enough to trigger it. This is much more convenient than manually measuring blood sugar before injecting insulin directly.

While markets are focused on the one-on-one beat, raising Novo shares at the expense of Eli Lilly’s, there is potentially more exciting news regarding semaglutide yet to come. Novo Nordisk has already demonstrated in a Phase II trial that an oral formulation of semaglutide can work as well. If this continues into Phase III, the implication could be big for diabetes treatment costs. Oral formulations of otherwise intravenous drugs increase patient compliance and, if it works better than GLP-1 agonists currently on the market, it could keep diabetes patients healthier for longer, reducing long-run costs as the disease progresses, by far the costliest aspect of diabetes.

Roche and the artificial pancreas

Another innovative way to increase patient compliance and reduce long-run costs is to simply automate everything. Roche Holding AG (RHHBY) is currently sponsoring a late-stage development of an artificial pancreas that uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology together with an insulin pump to keep diabetics’ blood sugar in perpetual balance.

A pivotal Phase III trial was announced late last month, cosponsored by Roche Diabetics Care Inc. The ingenious closed-loop system uses a smartphone app to notify patients when blood sugar levels go out of range of preset limits. Since most of the damage from diabetes occurs when patients are out of their blood sugar target ranges, by keeping diabetics range-bound for longer, and hopefully perpetually, much of the cumulative damage from diabetes can hopefully be blunted or maybe even prevented for the long run. This closed-loop artificial pancreas is currently intended for Type 1 diabetics, though if successful it may be trialed for the much more prevalent Type 2 population.

Oramed and oral insulin

Perhaps the most ambitious of new diabetes treatments is an oral insulin formulation from Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ORMP). Oramed just recently announced a planned Phase III trial for what has been termed the holy grail of diabetes treatments.

Oral insulin could fundamentally change the entire diabetes playing field since it would change the way insulin interacts with blood glucose and make the process more akin to what occurs in healthy people. Oramed is using similar technology to what Novo Nordisk is using in its own oral GLP-1 treatment, so there is reason to believe it could actually work.

Oral insulin could get prediabetics on insulin earlier since injecting insulin daily is not only inconvenient but almost taboo and a last resort. Getting prediabetics on insulin faster could go a long way in reducing late-stage complications as the disease progresses and insulin resistance sets in.

There is reason to believe insulin resistance – the factor that necessitates ever-higher doses of insulin and where most of the costs lay - will be less of a problem with an oral formulation because oral insulin goes through the liver, which is the natural organ for regulating insulin release once it receives it from the pancreas. It is a way of having the body naturally regulate insulin release rather than having to measure the dose via blood sugar analysis constantly.

All or any success amongst these three companies could take a significant bite out of overall diabetes costs over the next decade and beyond. Diabetes is by far the costliest health care niche and badly in need of a major advance. With three companies with potentially paradigm-shifting treatments in the pipe, chances are we will see that major advance before the close of this decade and before diabetes costs spiral completely out of control, if they have not done so already.",L,3.12

2017-08-22,NVAX,,Novavax: The Case For Going Long,"Market confidence in Novavax evaporated in 2016 after the failure of an RSV vaccine trial in the elderly population; investors remain dubious about the prospects of the ongoing maternal trial.

Concerns over Novavax’s ability to finance itself to the end of the maternal vaccine trial without dilution have further dampened investor sentiment.

Evidence suggests the next RSV vaccine trial will not be a repetition of the 2016 failure, but will succeed in line with past Phase II trials.

With negativity depressing the share price, a buying opportunity has emerged.

Positive interim topline results in 2018, and other positive news from the pipeline, will move the share price upward over the next few quarters.

I'm like the man from Texas. You see, the man from Missouri always says, 'You've got to show me.' But the man from Texas says, 'You've got to put it in my hand.'"" —Jack London
Novavax (NASDAQ: NVAX) is a clinical-stage biotech company with an enviable pipeline, including a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a disease that afflicts millions of people around the world. Novavax's maternal RSV vaccine candidate is in the Phase III clinical trial stage. Novavax's work toward a viable RSV vaccine won the backing of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2015, including up to $89 million in grants to support the development and clinical trials of a maternal vaccine.

Novavax's story goes well beyond just one vaccine, with other prospective drugs in the pipeline, including vaccines for the Zika virus and Ebola, as well as a novel nanoparticle flu vaccine that utilizes the company's proprietary Matrix-M adjuvant.

This would all seem to add up to an exceptional story. Unfortunately, there is a very serious hitch: In September 2016, the Phase III clinical trial of Novavax's RSV vaccine for elderly patients, dubbed “Resolve”, laid an egg. The trial failed to meet both its primary and secondary endpoints. The market reacted as one would expect, with Novavax's share price taking a more than 83 percent dive overnight. Since then, the stock has slipped further and now trades around $1.00 per share. That is a far cry from the $8.34 per share posted the day the Resolve trial results were announced.",L,8.0

About Recro Pharma, Inc.

Recro is a specialty pharmaceutical company that operates through two business divisions, an Acute Care, hospital product division and a revenue-generating contract development and manufacturing, or CDMO division, located at the Company's Gainesville facility. The Acute Care division is primarily focused on developing innovative products for hospital and other acute care settings. The Company's lead product candidate is a proprietary injectable form of meloxicam, a long-acting preferential COX-2 inhibitor. IV meloxicam 30mg has successfully completed two pivotal Phase III clinical efficacy trials in patients following bunionectomy and abdominoplasty surgeries, a large double blind Phase III safety trial, four Phase II clinical trials for the management of moderate to severe post-operative pain, as well as other safety studies. As injectable meloxicam is in the non-opioid class of drugs, the Company believes it will overcome many of the issues associated with commonly prescribed opioid therapeutics, including respiratory depression, constipation, excessive nausea and vomiting, as well as having no addictive potential while maintaining meaningful analgesic effects for relief of pain. The Company's CDMO division leverages its formulation expertise to develop and manufacture pharmaceutical products using its proprietary delivery technologies and other manufacturing services for commercial partners who commercialize or plan to commercialize these products. These collaborations can result in revenue streams including royalties, profit sharing, research and development and manufacturing fees, which support continued operations for its CDMO division and it contributes non-dilutive funding for the development and pre-commercialization activities of its Acute Care division.

Novo Nordisk and semaglutide

Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) recently announced its once-weekly GLP-1 agonist semaglutide handily beat Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide in terms of weight loss and blood sugar control in a pivotal Phase III trial. GLP-1 agonists, unlike insulin, stimulate pancreatic cells to produce insulin in a glucose-dependent manner. Meaning, GLP-1 agonists only induce native insulin production when blood glucose levels are high enough to trigger it. This is much more convenient than manually measuring blood sugar before injecting insulin directly.

While markets are focused on the one-on-one beat, raising Novo shares at the expense of Eli Lilly’s, there is potentially more exciting news regarding semaglutide yet to come. Novo Nordisk has already demonstrated in a Phase II trial that an oral formulation of semaglutide can work as well. If this continues into Phase III, the implication could be big for diabetes treatment costs. Oral formulations of otherwise intravenous drugs increase patient compliance and, if it works better than GLP-1 agonists currently on the market, it could keep diabetes patients healthier for longer, reducing long-run costs as the disease progresses, by far the costliest aspect of diabetes.

Another innovative way to increase patient compliance and reduce long-run costs is to simply automate everything. Roche Holding AG (RHHBY) is currently sponsoring a late-stage development of an artificial pancreas that uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology together with an insulin pump to keep diabetics’ blood sugar in perpetual balance.

A pivotal Phase III trial was announced late last month, cosponsored by Roche Diabetics Care Inc. The ingenious closed-loop system uses a smartphone app to notify patients when blood sugar levels go out of range of preset limits. Since most of the damage from diabetes occurs when patients are out of their blood sugar target ranges, by keeping diabetics range-bound for longer, and hopefully perpetually, much of the cumulative damage from diabetes can hopefully be blunted or maybe even prevented for the long run. This closed-loop artificial pancreas is currently intended for Type 1 diabetics, though if successful it may be trialed for the much more prevalent Type 2 population.

Perhaps the most ambitious of new diabetes treatments is an oral insulin formulation from Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ORMP). Oramed just recently announced a planned Phase III trial for what has been termed the holy grail of diabetes treatments.

Oral insulin could fundamentally change the entire diabetes playing field since it would change the way insulin interacts with blood glucose and make the process more akin to what occurs in healthy people. Oramed is using similar technology to what Novo Nordisk is using in its own oral GLP-1 treatment, so there is reason to believe it could actually work.

Oral insulin could get prediabetics on insulin earlier since injecting insulin daily is not only inconvenient but almost taboo and a last resort. Getting prediabetics on insulin faster could go a long way in reducing late-stage complications as the disease progresses and insulin resistance sets in.

There is reason to believe insulin resistance – the factor that necessitates ever-higher doses of insulin and where most of the costs lay - will be less of a problem with an oral formulation because oral insulin goes through the liver, which is the natural organ for regulating insulin release once it receives it from the pancreas. It is a way of having the body naturally regulate insulin release rather than having to measure the dose via blood sugar analysis constantly.

All or any success amongst these three companies could take a significant bite out of overall diabetes costs over the next decade and beyond. Diabetes is by far the costliest health care niche and badly in need of a major advance. With three companies with potentially paradigm-shifting treatments in the pipe, chances are we will see that major advance before the close of this decade and before diabetes costs spiral completely out of control, if they have not done so already.",L,1.05

2017-08-22,SHPG,,"Shire: At 52-Week Low, Long-Term Opportunity Appears Significant","Shire's share price has been languishing near 52-week lows for a little while now.

Despite valid concerns about the prospect of intense competition in its important hematology franchise, the business remains attractive.

New assets in ophthalmology and oncology are generating strong results already, and additional assets look set to continue the trend.

Baxalta deal is also going well, and the potential exit from neuroscience should consolidate its reputation as the rare disease specialist at a time when orphan drug growth is expected to grow rapidly.

Combined with a highly cash-generative and healthy business, Shire looks very attractive for long-term investors right now. Shire’s* (SHPG) share price recently hit a 52-week low in both its London- and NASDAQ-listed shares. Yet, I continue to struggle to precisely see why this should be the case. Its H1 2017 results showed a company which was doing well across its franchises except neuroscience in which continued destocking in the second quarter of the year pushed it into negative growth (Data source: Q2 2017 Results):  Yet, nothing immediately jumped out as being justification for continued weakness in its share price. After all, excluding the effects of destocking, even neuroscience had seen growth.

As we will see, however, Shire is certainly facing intense competition in some of its core areas. Yet, its success in fresh R&D results, combined with current and potential corporate level changes, suggests Shire is being undervalued right now. For long-term investors, today's somewhat subdued share price seems an ideal opportunity to buy into an increasingly compelling growth story coming from the world’s global leader in rare diseases.

A Hematology Hiatus Coming?

First off, we need to reflect a little on one of the main drivers of Shire’s share price weakness. Chiefly, this has surrounded increasing potential competition in some of its core franchises. This is especially true in its hematology franchise. Picked up as part of its Baxalta acquisition in 2016, it is now the largest revenue generator in the company. Yet, investors are getting a little nervous about potential threats in this area.

The subject has been more thoroughly explored by HealthBlogger last month. Shire has, however, a leading market position in the hematology market. Its ADVATE and ADYNOVATE are approved for use in the treatment of hemophilia without inhibitor (that is, for those patients who have not developed Factor VIII inhibitors). Indeed, ADVATE is the top Factor VIII brand with proven efficacy in the market. Similarly, for those who have developed Factor VIII inhibitors, Shire markets FEIBA which is an anti-inhibitor coagulant or bypassing agent. For Shire, this latter area contributes about 23% of total hematology revenue with the former contributing the lion’s share of the rest (Data source: Q2 2017 Results): However, competition is building. Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY) has seen its emicizumab (ACE910) drug perform well against its primary and all its secondary endpoints in its Phase III trial. As it explained:

The primary endpoint showed a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in treated bleeds of 87% (risk rate [RR]=0.13, p<0.0001) with emicizumab prophylaxis compared with on-demand (no prophylaxis; episodic use only) bypassing agents.
Although Shire and Roche are taking the battle of the treatments through the court, it is clear that should it reach the market (perhaps next year), it poses a sizeable threat to Feiba’s revenue. Shire’s CEO, Flemming Ornskov, argued that, despite reservations, ACE910 could result in hefty market share losses:

While we don't know for sure how much of our approximately $800 million in annual global sales of FEIBA is at risk, and this will most certainly be impacted by the potential approval timing, the final label and the future clinical and real-world data generated from patients, we do think that the market's current expectation for up to 50% share erosion after five years post-launch is reasonable. That said, we believe there will be no one-size-fits-all approach to treating these kinds of patients, and FEIBA will remain an important therapeutic option also in the future.
Roche is also in the process of releasing data on its Phase III trial pitching emicizumab into the hemophilia without inhibitors treatment. Naturally, should this readout be strong, this poses a threat to a far larger part of hematology revenue. Undoubtedly, as HealthBlogger highlighted:

The unmet need in this segment is much lower than in the inhibitor segment, because the factor VIII replacement therapy (i.e. ADVATE) is a high efficacious therapy for these patients, but if the drug will show a similar compelling profile also in this segment, it’s reasonable to assume that Shire will lose additional market share also in this therapeutic indication.
Roche is thus posing a looming and near-term threat to Shire’s strong position in the hematology market. Other competitors are also lining up to take a share of the spoils, however. BioMarin, for instance, has seen strong results from its Phase I/II trial of its BMN 270 gene therapy. Although it still needs to pass through the larger Phase III trial, some believe that BMN 270 could be on the market by 2019. This would undoubtedly put more pressure on Shire’s hematology revenue. With other pharma companies coming up with potential new drugs to take share from Shire’s already on-market drugs, investors are understandably a bit more aware of the potential frailty in its major revenue generator.

Nonetheless, Shire has not been standing still with its own pipeline in the hematology space. Its lanadelumab (SHP643) Phase III trial for heredity angioedema (NYSE:HAE) is showing early signs of strong promise in its primary and secondary endpoints. Shire may well be facing tougher competition in its core hemophilia market, yet its broader hematology franchise appears to be continuing its strong history of advances.

Lialda Laid Low?

Shire has also been facing a tough environment for its ulcerative colitis drug, LIALDA. The drug had become the star of its internal medicine franchise and contributed nearly 6% of total revenue in Q2 2017:

News that Zydus Cadila had been given approval by the FDA to release a generic of the drug, therefore, was hardly well received by investors. The arrival of the LIALDA generic was, as Shire’s CEO Flemming Ornskov noted, “a little earlier than [they] anticipated.”

As a result, this had driven down the revenue predictions for FY 2017 to between $14.3 billion and $14.6 billion (driven, as it explained, primarily by the generics arrival). Despite this, however, it remains the only generic on the market at present and as such Shire believes it can keep its market share fairly healthy. As Ornskov explained:

in a market with one generic competitor and, for the matter, even if there was a second, we think we can maintain a reasonable share of this market in the next few years.
Clearly, however, it will impact upon margins for the drug. What is more, it is hard to argue with Ornskov when he explained that “longer term, [maintaining market share] will become increasingly difficult.”

Although an unwelcome revenue shock, however, Shire remains well-placed in its internal medicine franchise. GATTEX, its drug for short bowel syndrome, saw its constant-currency revenue growth jump 70% in Q2 2017. With Shire directing its LIALDA sales teams to focus on GATTEX, we can expect to see continued strong growth in this drugs revenue contribution. Indeed, its performance should be strong enough to soften the blow coming from the revenue declines seen in the LIALDA business.

The threats to its hematological and LIALDA revenue are certainly something to watch, yet it is important to note that Shire has a great many opportunities facing it which investors have perhaps forgotten in the face of recent news flow.

Ophthalmology Opportunity

Ophthalmology is a new business area. It opened a unit back in May 2014 seeing an opportunity to do as it has done throughout its history: fill a research vacuum in rare and specialty diseases.

XIIDRA (picked up as part of their $160 million acquisition of SARcode in 2013) received approval in July 2016. It was the first drug to treat both the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. This gives it the edge on the established market drug, RESTASIS, already generated strong revenue for Allergan (AGN). XIIDRA also has another benefit over RESTASIS: it works faster.

Unsurprisingly, therefore, XIIDRA has already shown good revenue momentum. As Jeffrey Poulton, Shire’s CFO, noted:

We continue to be pleased with the performance of XIIDRA since launch. XIIDRA contributed $57 million in sales during the quarter, as prescription demand increased 13% from Q1, with market share increasing to approximately 23% by the end of Q2.
Indeed, it has already built up its market share rapidly since it was launched (Data source: Q1 2017 Results Presentation): Yet, here is the thing, this is a huge market share despite the fact that XIIDRA has not yet gained access to a large part of the DED market. As Poulton added at Q1 2017:

Importantly, this very impressive [market share] gain has been primarily driven by our ability to command share in the commercial insurance market, where XIIDRA has broad coverage. In the commercial market alone, our share is, of course, much higher than 22%. As you may know, we do not have broad Medicare coverage yet. I remain optimistic that we will be able to improve access to the Medicare population, who accounts for more than 40% of the current dry eye disease market.
Adding later that:

We’re building this [XIIDRA] brand into a blockbuster like we did with VYVANSE, step-by-step, keeping in mind we have patents until 2029 and expect few potential competitive entrants before XIIDRA’s patent expiry.
What is more, Shire has good pipeline prospects for building a more broad-based ophthalmology franchise. As well as additional DED developments, it has good trial progress in glaucoma and infectious conjunctivitis (Source: Shire Ophthalmology Pipeline in July 2017):",L,1.81

Initial data from the first six patients is extremely encouraging demonstrating a dose response in biomarkers (such as urinary GAG and CSF GAG) and suggestive evidence that the patients are experiencing a neurocognitive benefit. In fact, the clinical trial data presented during the past six months on this product really couldn't have been any better. You can read about this product in my initial report and see the initial clinical trial data in the company presentation.

Now, researchers report that results from a phase III clinical trial may help oncologists determine those lung cancer patients, and possibly, mesothelioma patients, who will benefit from the immuno-oncology drug.

Opdivo, developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, works by blocking the PD-L1 protein and activating the immune system, leading it to attack and kill cancer cells. According to a June 21 press release from The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, a team of researchers led by David Carbone, MD, PhD, of The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer – Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute, found that although the trial did not improve progression-free survival when compared with chemotherapy in the overall population, those patients with a high expression of PD-L1 did benefit.

“The good news is that we discovered that a subset of patients who had both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status did experience a significant benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

Specifically, the researchers report that patients who had “both high tumor mutation burden and high PDL-1 positive status” realized a 75 percent response rate compared to just 16 percent response rate with low mutation burden and low PDL-1. However, the response rates for chemotherapy treatment in these same subsets were nearly the same leading the researchers to conclude that the PDL-1 markers “were selective for immunotherapy.”

Mesothelioma, a rare, asbestos-related cancer of the lining of the lungs, abdomen or heart, is highly aggressive and is resistant to many cancer treatments. The prognosis for mesothelioma patients is usually grim: the average survival time varies from 4 – 18 months after diagnosis. For the close to 3,000 Americans diagnosed with the disease each year, personalized care may bring a breakthrough treatment not previously considered by their physician.

The benefits of personalized care for mesothelioma patients have been proven where researchers have identified genetic biomarkers that reflect the aggressiveness of mesothelioma as well as markers that can assess the effectiveness of a particular treatment.

Opdivo is currently in a phase III clinical trial in the UK for mesothelioma patients. Known as The CheckpOiNt Blockade For Inhibition of Relapsed Mesothelioma, or CONIFRM, the trial has a goal of ‘exploiting the potential of immunotherapy.’

Keytruda, which gained popularity after saving former President Jimmy Carter’s life after sending his melanoma into remission, is also a PD-L1 inhibitor. Both immunotherapy drugs have shown in studies to be effective in fighting pleural mesothelioma. Keytruda is, perhaps, more well known due to eight-year mesothelioma survivor Mavis Nye of England, who went into remission after a two-year clinical trial of the drug.

“This study is an important step toward understanding the impact of tumor mutation burden and PDL-1 in immunotherapy response. This data shows we should evaluate these two factors independently to most accurately define who will benefit from immunotherapy,” says Carbone.

(CRME) (COM.TO) plunged more than 32% on Monday as the FDA is not satisfied with the data package proposed by the Company to support the resubmission of its Brinavess New Drug Application.

Brinavess is used to rapidly restore normal heart rhythm in adult patients (aged 18 years or over) who have recently started having atrial fibrillation.

In its most recent communication with the FDA, the Company proposed resubmission of the NDA based upon the original file and six years of accumulated safety data from sales of BRINAVESS in thirty-three countries, augmented by interim results from over 1,100 patients enrolled in the SPECTRUM study, a prospective post-authorization European Union safety study, along with pre-clinical data from subsequent studies the Company completed at the FDA's request.

2017-08-22,CYTK,https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/handwriting-on-the-wall-suggests-progress-in-als-may-be-imminent-says-cytokinetics-ceo," 'Writing on the wall' suggests progress in ALS may be imminent, says Cytokinetics CEO","San Franciscan firm Cytokinetics (Nasdaq: CYTK) is pursuing an unusual angle to therapeutic discovery, starting from an understanding of the biology of muscles in order to explore treatment options in different disease areas.

This approach has seen the company develop a diverse pipeline of candidates, in heart failure, in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where lead candidate tirasemtiv is due to read out at Phase III later this year.

Launched 20 years ago, chief executive Robert Blum was with the firm from the start, leading in R&D and ultimately taking the tiller a few years after they went public in 2004.

Commenting on the company’s philosophy, Mr Blum points to: ""A pipeline that builds on one another, in terms of economies in drug discovery and synergies in drug development activities.""

Amgen collaboration in heart failure

As an example, he cites the company’s long-standing collaboration with fellow Californian biotech Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN), which he says has enabled investment in longer shots such as tirasemtiv.

""[Omecamtiv mecarbil] could ultimately be our most valuable program, and that has afforded us some advantages.""

""That's how we can make the commitment, take the risk, on tirasemtiv. Because we have partnered in other programs, most importantly omecamtiv mecarbil, with Amgen.”

“That could ultimately be our most valuable program, and that has afforded us some advantages. This candidate addresses a very large unmet need - high-risk heart failure patients who are recently hospitalized and therefore at high risk of death or readmission.”

“Heart failure is the largest cardiovascular market that is not well served by existing therapies. It's the number one reason why people over the age of 65 are hospitalized and the single largest line item in the pharmacotherapy budget for Medicare.”

Through its collaborations, Cytokinetics has been able to raise primarily non-diutive capital of over $500 million.

The economic potential in one program feeds into the rest of the company’s portfolio.

Mr Blum says: “As the drug went into Phase III it triggered milestone payments that enabled us to co-invest with Amgen to buy up our royalty economics.”

“We then sold a piece of those to generate additional capital, that we could invest in tirasemtiv.”

“I think this is most possible when you can organically build a pipeline by being the leader in one slice of biology. That affords these kinds of opportunities.""

Astellas collaboration in ALS

As well as Amgen, Cytokinetics is partnered with Japan’s Astellas Pharma (TYO: 4503), this time to develop treatments in neuromuscular indications.

While traditional approaches to ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, have sought to combat the condition from the perspective of nerve decay, Cytokinetics is looking at the disease through the prism of muscle biology, “remaining agnostic as to why the nerves may be degenerating.”

Mr Blum says: “We do know that the muscles are ultimately where the action is in the disease. Patients who live with ALS suffer a ruthless decline of muscle function, and typically die within three to four years, of respiratory failure and pneumonia.""

Cytokinetics believes its compound will be able to increase muscle force, empower and delay the time to muscle weakness and fatigue.

Recognizing the high burden of the disease and the high level of unmet need In ALS, Mr Blum says: “We knew that that could provide a very meaningful new opportunity to address the disease in ways unlike any other.""

The deal with Astellas was synergistic, as both companies are operating in the same research space. Mr Blum saw an advantage to combining their programs, as the company is: “making a major commitment to muscle biology, and employing different approaches that we thought to be quite complementary to ours.""

Cytokinetics has sold to Astellas an option on tirasemtiv, which would provide rights to co-develop and co-commercialize the drug outside of North America and Europe, where the American firm retains exclusivity.

Mr Blum says data from a large Phase III trial into the candidate will be presented at the annual International Symposium on ALS/MND, in Boston, in December.

“This is designed to confirm and extend findings from our earlier studies.”

""If the data are positive, we as a company are ready for regulatory filings in the US and Europe by mid-2018 to support our commercial activities. We're intending to commercialize this drug candidate ourselves in North America and Europe.""

Positive regulatory environment for ALS

Of particular interest in this therapeutic area is the recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of Radicava (edaravone), the first new drug in ALS for over two decades.

""The handwriting on the wall suggests that the division of neurology is accelerating review and approval of certain drugs for high unmet need.”

Unusually, the positive decision was the result of the FDA calling on the drugmaker, Japan’s Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma (TYO: 4508), to file for marketing authorization.

Asked whether this suggests a more positive approach toward expediting therapies, including for ALS, Mr Blum says: ""Yes, I think it probably does. The handwriting on the wall suggests that the division of neurology is accelerating review and approval of certain drugs for high unmet need.”

""What was noteworthy about the approval was that the trials seemed to be conflicting in terms of efficacy. I think the FDA was compelled by the fact that the drug appears to be safe, and they approved the drug subject to post-marketing conditions.""

""It's an important advance for the field, to be sure, but I think it will be interesting to see how it will be commercialized, and what the uptake will be.""

Under the stewardship of new FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, the FDA appears to be taking a more proactive approach, including hiring more staff, to bring innovative therapies to patients expeditiously.

Asked about progress at the FDA, Mr Blum says: ""From what I can see, things are moving forward very constructively. I think there's an opportunity for patients, caregivers, regulatory authorities, industry sponsors and everybody to align more on innovation, and create opportunities for new medicines that are truly innovative, to move forward swiftly.""
""I think the changes at the FDA underscore their commitment to the original intent of biopharmaceutical innovation, and that's the most encouraging sign coming out of Washington.""",L,4.42

2017-08-21,IRWD,https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Ironwood+Pharma+%28IRWD%29+Announces+FDA+Approval+of+DUZALLO+for+Treatment+of+Hyperuricemia+in+Patients+with+Uncontrolled+Gout/13222622.html,,"Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IRWD) today announced DUZALLO was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a once-daily oral treatment for hyperuricemia associated with gout in patients who have not achieved target serum uric acid (sUA) levels with a medically appropriate daily dose of allopurinol alone. DUZALLO is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Ironwood expects DUZALLO to be commercially available early in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Gout is a highly symptomatic and painful form of inflammatory arthritis caused by hyperuricemia, or elevated sUA levels in the blood, which can lead to painful flares and serious potential long-term health consequences.DUZALLO is the first drug that combines the current standard of care for the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout, allopurinol, with the most recent FDA-approved treatment for this condition, lesinurad. This fixed-dose combination provides a dual mechanism of action in a single tablet that can address both underlying causes of hyperuricemia – overproduction and underexcretion of serum uric acid.

“The approval of DUZALLO provides a new fixed-dose and dual-mechanism treatment option to help patients with uncontrolled gout achieve target serum uric acid levels. This represents an important and needed new option in the treatment of hyperuricemia,” said Michael A. Becker, M.D., professor emeritus of medicine, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL. “Gout is a serious and potentially progressive and debilitating inflammatory disease. Getting patients with gout to serum urate goal, and keeping them at or below goal, are essential to success in treating these patients. DUZALLO will help reduce the significant unmet need among patients in the U.S. who fail to get their serum uric acid levels to goal despite taking allopurinol alone.”

“With DUZALLO, nearly twice as many patients with uncontrolled gout may be able to achieve target serum uric acid levels compared to those patients taking allopurinol alone, which is important, considering the significant unmet need among uncontrolled gout patients to get to goal of under 6 mg/dL,” said Tom McCourt, senior vice president of marketing and sales and chief commercial officer at Ironwood. “We believe DUZALLO will be the critical driver behind Ironwood’s gout franchise, which is expected to exceed total annual U.S. peak sales of $300 million.”",L,2.65

DUZALLO is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia. The drug is expected to be commercially available early in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Gout, the most common inflammatory arthritis in adults, is a highly symptomatic and painful form of inflammatory arthritis caused by hyperuricemia - high serum uric acid (sUA) levels in the blood.

DUZALLO becomes the second gout drug in Ironwood's product portfolio. Last April, the Company acquired the exclusive U.S. rights to gout drug ZURAMPIC from AstraZeneca plc (AZN).

ZURAMPIC was approved by the FDA in December 2015 to be used in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI) for the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout. ZURAMPIC is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia and should not be used as monotherapy.

One Harvard study puts the annual cost at a much higher $822 billion annually. Whichever number you want to believe, it is among the costliest diseases in the world, for both patients and taxpayers. Thanks to Medicare and Medicaid, diabetes costs are socialized.



There are two reasons for the rising costs. First, the price of insulin has tripled since 2002. Second, the nature of lifetime treatment necessitates ever-rising doses of insulin as the disease progresses.

Novo Nordisk and semaglutide

Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) recently announced its once-weekly GLP-1 agonist semaglutide handily beat Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide in terms of weight loss and blood sugar control in a pivotal Phase III trial. GLP-1 agonists, unlike insulin, stimulate pancreatic cells to produce insulin in a glucose-dependent manner. Meaning, GLP-1 agonists only induce native insulin production when blood glucose levels are high enough to trigger it. This is much more convenient than manually measuring blood sugar before injecting insulin directly.

While markets are focused on the one-on-one beat, raising Novo shares at the expense of Eli Lilly’s, there is potentially more exciting news regarding semaglutide yet to come. Novo Nordisk has already demonstrated in a Phase II trial that an oral formulation of semaglutide can work as well. If this continues into Phase III, the implication could be big for diabetes treatment costs. Oral formulations of otherwise intravenous drugs increase patient compliance and, if it works better than GLP-1 agonists currently on the market, it could keep diabetes patients healthier for longer, reducing long-run costs as the disease progresses, by far the costliest aspect of diabetes.

Roche and the artificial pancreas

Another innovative way to increase patient compliance and reduce long-run costs is to simply automate everything. Roche Holding AG (RHHBY) is currently sponsoring a late-stage development of an artificial pancreas that uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology together with an insulin pump to keep diabetics’ blood sugar in perpetual balance.

A pivotal Phase III trial was announced late last month, cosponsored by Roche Diabetics Care Inc. The ingenious closed-loop system uses a smartphone app to notify patients when blood sugar levels go out of range of preset limits. Since most of the damage from diabetes occurs when patients are out of their blood sugar target ranges, by keeping diabetics range-bound for longer, and hopefully perpetually, much of the cumulative damage from diabetes can hopefully be blunted or maybe even prevented for the long run. This closed-loop artificial pancreas is currently intended for Type 1 diabetics, though if successful it may be trialed for the much more prevalent Type 2 population.

Oramed and oral insulin

Perhaps the most ambitious of new diabetes treatments is an oral insulin formulation from Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ORMP). Oramed just recently announced a planned Phase III trial for what has been termed the holy grail of diabetes treatments.

Oral insulin could fundamentally change the entire diabetes playing field since it would change the way insulin interacts with blood glucose and make the process more akin to what occurs in healthy people. Oramed is using similar technology to what Novo Nordisk is using in its own oral GLP-1 treatment, so there is reason to believe it could actually work.

Oral insulin could get prediabetics on insulin earlier since injecting insulin daily is not only inconvenient but almost taboo and a last resort. Getting prediabetics on insulin faster could go a long way in reducing late-stage complications as the disease progresses and insulin resistance sets in.

There is reason to believe insulin resistance – the factor that necessitates ever-higher doses of insulin and where most of the costs lay - will be less of a problem with an oral formulation because oral insulin goes through the liver, which is the natural organ for regulating insulin release once it receives it from the pancreas. It is a way of having the body naturally regulate insulin release rather than having to measure the dose via blood sugar analysis constantly.

All or any success amongst these three companies could take a significant bite out of overall diabetes costs over the next decade and beyond. Diabetes is by far the costliest health care niche and badly in need of a major advance. With three companies with potentially paradigm-shifting treatments in the pipe, chances are we will see that major advance before the close of this decade and before diabetes costs spiral completely out of control, if they have not done so already.",L,3.12

2017-08-22,NVAX,,Novavax: The Case For Going Long,"Market confidence in Novavax evaporated in 2016 after the failure of an RSV vaccine trial in the elderly population; investors remain dubious about the prospects of the ongoing maternal trial.

Concerns over Novavax’s ability to finance itself to the end of the maternal vaccine trial without dilution have further dampened investor sentiment.

Evidence suggests the next RSV vaccine trial will not be a repetition of the 2016 failure, but will succeed in line with past Phase II trials.

With negativity depressing the share price, a buying opportunity has emerged.

Positive interim topline results in 2018, and other positive news from the pipeline, will move the share price upward over the next few quarters.

I'm like the man from Texas. You see, the man from Missouri always says, 'You've got to show me.' But the man from Texas says, 'You've got to put it in my hand.'"" —Jack London
Novavax (NASDAQ: NVAX) is a clinical-stage biotech company with an enviable pipeline, including a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a disease that afflicts millions of people around the world. Novavax's maternal RSV vaccine candidate is in the Phase III clinical trial stage. Novavax's work toward a viable RSV vaccine won the backing of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2015, including up to $89 million in grants to support the development and clinical trials of a maternal vaccine.

Novavax's story goes well beyond just one vaccine, with other prospective drugs in the pipeline, including vaccines for the Zika virus and Ebola, as well as a novel nanoparticle flu vaccine that utilizes the company's proprietary Matrix-M adjuvant.

This would all seem to add up to an exceptional story. Unfortunately, there is a very serious hitch: In September 2016, the Phase III clinical trial of Novavax's RSV vaccine for elderly patients, dubbed “Resolve”, laid an egg. The trial failed to meet both its primary and secondary endpoints. The market reacted as one would expect, with Novavax's share price taking a more than 83 percent dive overnight. Since then, the stock has slipped further and now trades around $1.00 per share. That is a far cry from the $8.34 per share posted the day the Resolve trial results were announced.",L,8.0

Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) recently announced its once-weekly GLP-1 agonist semaglutide handily beat Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide in terms of weight loss and blood sugar control in a pivotal Phase III trial. GLP-1 agonists, unlike insulin, stimulate pancreatic cells to produce insulin in a glucose-dependent manner. Meaning, GLP-1 agonists only induce native insulin production when blood glucose levels are high enough to trigger it. This is much more convenient than manually measuring blood sugar before injecting insulin directly.

While markets are focused on the one-on-one beat, raising Novo shares at the expense of Eli Lilly’s, there is potentially more exciting news regarding semaglutide yet to come. Novo Nordisk has already demonstrated in a Phase II trial that an oral formulation of semaglutide can work as well. If this continues into Phase III, the implication could be big for diabetes treatment costs. Oral formulations of otherwise intravenous drugs increase patient compliance and, if it works better than GLP-1 agonists currently on the market, it could keep diabetes patients healthier for longer, reducing long-run costs as the disease progresses, by far the costliest aspect of diabetes.

Roche and the artificial pancreas

Another innovative way to increase patient compliance and reduce long-run costs is to simply automate everything. Roche Holding AG (RHHBY) is currently sponsoring a late-stage development of an artificial pancreas that uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology together with an insulin pump to keep diabetics’ blood sugar in perpetual balance.

A pivotal Phase III trial was announced late last month, cosponsored by Roche Diabetics Care Inc. The ingenious closed-loop system uses a smartphone app to notify patients when blood sugar levels go out of range of preset limits. Since most of the damage from diabetes occurs when patients are out of their blood sugar target ranges, by keeping diabetics range-bound for longer, and hopefully perpetually, much of the cumulative damage from diabetes can hopefully be blunted or maybe even prevented for the long run. This closed-loop artificial pancreas is currently intended for Type 1 diabetics, though if successful it may be trialed for the much more prevalent Type 2 population.

Oramed and oral insulin

Perhaps the most ambitious of new diabetes treatments is an oral insulin formulation from Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ORMP). Oramed just recently announced a planned Phase III trial for what has been termed the holy grail of diabetes treatments.

Oral insulin could fundamentally change the entire diabetes playing field since it would change the way insulin interacts with blood glucose and make the process more akin to what occurs in healthy people. Oramed is using similar technology to what Novo Nordisk is using in its own oral GLP-1 treatment, so there is reason to believe it could actually work.

Oral insulin could get prediabetics on insulin earlier since injecting insulin daily is not only inconvenient but almost taboo and a last resort. Getting prediabetics on insulin faster could go a long way in reducing late-stage complications as the disease progresses and insulin resistance sets in.

There is reason to believe insulin resistance – the factor that necessitates ever-higher doses of insulin and where most of the costs lay - will be less of a problem with an oral formulation because oral insulin goes through the liver, which is the natural organ for regulating insulin release once it receives it from the pancreas. It is a way of having the body naturally regulate insulin release rather than having to measure the dose via blood sugar analysis constantly.

All or any success amongst these three companies could take a significant bite out of overall diabetes costs over the next decade and beyond. Diabetes is by far the costliest health care niche and badly in need of a major advance. With three companies with potentially paradigm-shifting treatments in the pipe, chances are we will see that major advance before the close of this decade and before diabetes costs spiral completely out of control, if they have not done so already.",L,2.1

About Recro Pharma, Inc.

Recro is a specialty pharmaceutical company that operates through two business divisions, an Acute Care, hospital product division and a revenue-generating contract development and manufacturing, or CDMO division, located at the Company's Gainesville facility. The Acute Care division is primarily focused on developing innovative products for hospital and other acute care settings. The Company's lead product candidate is a proprietary injectable form of meloxicam, a long-acting preferential COX-2 inhibitor. IV meloxicam 30mg has successfully completed two pivotal Phase III clinical efficacy trials in patients following bunionectomy and abdominoplasty surgeries, a large double blind Phase III safety trial, four Phase II clinical trials for the management of moderate to severe post-operative pain, as well as other safety studies. As injectable meloxicam is in the non-opioid class of drugs, the Company believes it will overcome many of the issues associated with commonly prescribed opioid therapeutics, including respiratory depression, constipation, excessive nausea and vomiting, as well as having no addictive potential while maintaining meaningful analgesic effects for relief of pain. The Company's CDMO division leverages its formulation expertise to develop and manufacture pharmaceutical products using its proprietary delivery technologies and other manufacturing services for commercial partners who commercialize or plan to commercialize these products. These collaborations can result in revenue streams including royalties, profit sharing, research and development and manufacturing fees, which support continued operations for its CDMO division and it contributes non-dilutive funding for the development and pre-commercialization activities of its Acute Care division.

2017-08-21,RHHBY,https://www.gurufocus.com/news/556495/3-companies-aiming-to-significantly-reduce-diabetes-treatment-costs,,"Total U.S. health care spending in 2015 was an astronomical $3.2 trillion. That is 16% of the entire national debt. As much as we blame the prices of new drugs for this gargantuan sum, one of the biggest chunks of it comes from diabetes, a disease whose treatment has not changed all that much since 1922. According to the American Diabetes Association, diabetes accounts for $322 billion in total U.S. health care spending as of 2016.

One Harvard study puts the annual cost at a much higher $822 billion annually. Whichever number you want to believe, it is among the costliest diseases in the world, for both patients and taxpayers. Thanks to Medicare and Medicaid, diabetes costs are socialized.



There are two reasons for the rising costs. First, the price of insulin has tripled since 2002. Second, the nature of lifetime treatment necessitates ever-rising doses of insulin as the disease progresses.

Short of hoping Americans radically change their diets overnight and drastically reduce sugar intake, the problem is not going away. But there is hope for significant cost reduction nonetheless. Here are three companies on the cutting edge of the newest diabetes advancements that, with some luck, may help reduce this nearly unfathomable cost to the U.S. economy and taxpayers.

2017-08-22,SHPG,,"Shire: At 52-Week Low, Long-Term Opportunity Appears Significant","Shire's share price has been languishing near 52-week lows for a little while now.

Despite valid concerns about the prospect of intense competition in its important hematology franchise, the business remains attractive.

New assets in ophthalmology and oncology are generating strong results already, and additional assets look set to continue the trend.

Baxalta deal is also going well, and the potential exit from neuroscience should consolidate its reputation as the rare disease specialist at a time when orphan drug growth is expected to grow rapidly.

Combined with a highly cash-generative and healthy business, Shire looks very attractive for long-term investors right now. Shire’s* (SHPG) share price recently hit a 52-week low in both its London- and NASDAQ-listed shares. Yet, I continue to struggle to precisely see why this should be the case. Its H1 2017 results showed a company which was doing well across its franchises except neuroscience in which continued destocking in the second quarter of the year pushed it into negative growth (Data source: Q2 2017 Results):  Yet, nothing immediately jumped out as being justification for continued weakness in its share price. After all, excluding the effects of destocking, even neuroscience had seen growth.

As we will see, however, Shire is certainly facing intense competition in some of its core areas. Yet, its success in fresh R&D results, combined with current and potential corporate level changes, suggests Shire is being undervalued right now. For long-term investors, today's somewhat subdued share price seems an ideal opportunity to buy into an increasingly compelling growth story coming from the world’s global leader in rare diseases.

A Hematology Hiatus Coming?

First off, we need to reflect a little on one of the main drivers of Shire’s share price weakness. Chiefly, this has surrounded increasing potential competition in some of its core franchises. This is especially true in its hematology franchise. Picked up as part of its Baxalta acquisition in 2016, it is now the largest revenue generator in the company. Yet, investors are getting a little nervous about potential threats in this area.

The subject has been more thoroughly explored by HealthBlogger last month. Shire has, however, a leading market position in the hematology market. Its ADVATE and ADYNOVATE are approved for use in the treatment of hemophilia without inhibitor (that is, for those patients who have not developed Factor VIII inhibitors). Indeed, ADVATE is the top Factor VIII brand with proven efficacy in the market. Similarly, for those who have developed Factor VIII inhibitors, Shire markets FEIBA which is an anti-inhibitor coagulant or bypassing agent. For Shire, this latter area contributes about 23% of total hematology revenue with the former contributing the lion’s share of the rest (Data source: Q2 2017 Results): However, competition is building. Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY) has seen its emicizumab (ACE910) drug perform well against its primary and all its secondary endpoints in its Phase III trial. As it explained:

The primary endpoint showed a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in treated bleeds of 87% (risk rate [RR]=0.13, p<0.0001) with emicizumab prophylaxis compared with on-demand (no prophylaxis; episodic use only) bypassing agents.
Although Shire and Roche are taking the battle of the treatments through the court, it is clear that should it reach the market (perhaps next year), it poses a sizeable threat to Feiba’s revenue. Shire’s CEO, Flemming Ornskov, argued that, despite reservations, ACE910 could result in hefty market share losses:

While we don't know for sure how much of our approximately $800 million in annual global sales of FEIBA is at risk, and this will most certainly be impacted by the potential approval timing, the final label and the future clinical and real-world data generated from patients, we do think that the market's current expectation for up to 50% share erosion after five years post-launch is reasonable. That said, we believe there will be no one-size-fits-all approach to treating these kinds of patients, and FEIBA will remain an important therapeutic option also in the future.
Roche is also in the process of releasing data on its Phase III trial pitching emicizumab into the hemophilia without inhibitors treatment. Naturally, should this readout be strong, this poses a threat to a far larger part of hematology revenue. Undoubtedly, as HealthBlogger highlighted:

The unmet need in this segment is much lower than in the inhibitor segment, because the factor VIII replacement therapy (i.e. ADVATE) is a high efficacious therapy for these patients, but if the drug will show a similar compelling profile also in this segment, it’s reasonable to assume that Shire will lose additional market share also in this therapeutic indication.
Roche is thus posing a looming and near-term threat to Shire’s strong position in the hematology market. Other competitors are also lining up to take a share of the spoils, however. BioMarin, for instance, has seen strong results from its Phase I/II trial of its BMN 270 gene therapy. Although it still needs to pass through the larger Phase III trial, some believe that BMN 270 could be on the market by 2019. This would undoubtedly put more pressure on Shire’s hematology revenue. With other pharma companies coming up with potential new drugs to take share from Shire’s already on-market drugs, investors are understandably a bit more aware of the potential frailty in its major revenue generator.

Nonetheless, Shire has not been standing still with its own pipeline in the hematology space. Its lanadelumab (SHP643) Phase III trial for heredity angioedema (NYSE:HAE) is showing early signs of strong promise in its primary and secondary endpoints. Shire may well be facing tougher competition in its core hemophilia market, yet its broader hematology franchise appears to be continuing its strong history of advances.

Lialda Laid Low?

Shire has also been facing a tough environment for its ulcerative colitis drug, LIALDA. The drug had become the star of its internal medicine franchise and contributed nearly 6% of total revenue in Q2 2017:

News that Zydus Cadila had been given approval by the FDA to release a generic of the drug, therefore, was hardly well received by investors. The arrival of the LIALDA generic was, as Shire’s CEO Flemming Ornskov noted, “a little earlier than [they] anticipated.”

As a result, this had driven down the revenue predictions for FY 2017 to between $14.3 billion and $14.6 billion (driven, as it explained, primarily by the generics arrival). Despite this, however, it remains the only generic on the market at present and as such Shire believes it can keep its market share fairly healthy. As Ornskov explained:

in a market with one generic competitor and, for the matter, even if there was a second, we think we can maintain a reasonable share of this market in the next few years.
Clearly, however, it will impact upon margins for the drug. What is more, it is hard to argue with Ornskov when he explained that “longer term, [maintaining market share] will become increasingly difficult.”

Although an unwelcome revenue shock, however, Shire remains well-placed in its internal medicine franchise. GATTEX, its drug for short bowel syndrome, saw its constant-currency revenue growth jump 70% in Q2 2017. With Shire directing its LIALDA sales teams to focus on GATTEX, we can expect to see continued strong growth in this drugs revenue contribution. Indeed, its performance should be strong enough to soften the blow coming from the revenue declines seen in the LIALDA business.

The threats to its hematological and LIALDA revenue are certainly something to watch, yet it is important to note that Shire has a great many opportunities facing it which investors have perhaps forgotten in the face of recent news flow.

Ophthalmology Opportunity

Ophthalmology is a new business area. It opened a unit back in May 2014 seeing an opportunity to do as it has done throughout its history: fill a research vacuum in rare and specialty diseases.

XIIDRA (picked up as part of their $160 million acquisition of SARcode in 2013) received approval in July 2016. It was the first drug to treat both the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. This gives it the edge on the established market drug, RESTASIS, already generated strong revenue for Allergan (AGN). XIIDRA also has another benefit over RESTASIS: it works faster.

Unsurprisingly, therefore, XIIDRA has already shown good revenue momentum. As Jeffrey Poulton, Shire’s CFO, noted:

We continue to be pleased with the performance of XIIDRA since launch. XIIDRA contributed $57 million in sales during the quarter, as prescription demand increased 13% from Q1, with market share increasing to approximately 23% by the end of Q2.
Indeed, it has already built up its market share rapidly since it was launched (Data source: Q1 2017 Results Presentation): Yet, here is the thing, this is a huge market share despite the fact that XIIDRA has not yet gained access to a large part of the DED market. As Poulton added at Q1 2017:

Importantly, this very impressive [market share] gain has been primarily driven by our ability to command share in the commercial insurance market, where XIIDRA has broad coverage. In the commercial market alone, our share is, of course, much higher than 22%. As you may know, we do not have broad Medicare coverage yet. I remain optimistic that we will be able to improve access to the Medicare population, who accounts for more than 40% of the current dry eye disease market.
Adding later that:

We’re building this [XIIDRA] brand into a blockbuster like we did with VYVANSE, step-by-step, keeping in mind we have patents until 2029 and expect few potential competitive entrants before XIIDRA’s patent expiry.
What is more, Shire has good pipeline prospects for building a more broad-based ophthalmology franchise. As well as additional DED developments, it has good trial progress in glaucoma and infectious conjunctivitis (Source: Shire Ophthalmology Pipeline in July 2017):",L,1.81
